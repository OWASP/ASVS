# Mapping files

Versions:

* v4.0.3 - latest v4 release
* v5.0.be - "bleeding edge" version for v5.0 development, where all v4.0 structure and numbers were kept directly or as placeholders
* v5.0 - v5.0 after re-structuring and re-numbering everything

Mapping files:

* `mapping_v5.0.be_to_v5.0.0.yml` - from v5.0.be to v5.0.0
* `mapping_v4.0.3_to_v5.0.0.yml` - from v4.0.3 to v5.0.0
* `mapping_v5.0.0_to_v4.0.3.yml` - from v5.0.0 to v4.0.3

Temporary mapping files before re-numbering everything:

* `mapping_v4.0.3_to_v5.0.be.yml` - from v4.0.3 to v5.0.be
* `mapping_v5.0.be_to_v4.0.3.yml` - from v5.0.be to v4.0.3

Just-in-case exports before deleted from v5.0.be:

* `nist.md` - v5.0.be requirement ids and mapping to NIST 800-63B identifiers before those were removed
* `v5.0.be_cwe_mapping.json` - v5.0.be requirement ids and mapping to CWE identifiers before those were removed
