# ASVS란 무엇인가?

애플리케이션 보안 검증 표준(Application Security Verification Standard; ASVS)은 웹 애플리케이션 및 서비스의 보안 요구사항을 정의하며, 보안 애플리케이션을 설계, 개발, 유지보수하거나 보안을 평가하는 모든 사람에게 유용한 자료이다.

이 장은 ASVS 사용의 필수적인 측면을 다루며, 여기에는 범위, 우선순위 기반 레벨 구조, 표준의 주요 사용 사례가 포함된다.

## ASVS의 범위

ASVS의 범위는 명칭인 애플리케이션, 보안, 검증, 표준에 의해 정의된다. 이는 궁극적으로 달성해야 하는 보안 원칙을 식별하는 목표를 가지고 포함되거나 제외되는 요구사항을 설정한다. 이 범위는 구현 요구사항의 토대 역할을 하는 문서화 요구사항 또한 고려한다.

공격자에게는 범위라는 개념이 존재하지 않는다. 따라서 ASVS 요구사항은 CI/CD 프로세스, 호스팅, 운영 활동을 포함한 애플리케이션 수명 주기의 다른 측면에 대한 지침과 함께 평가되어야 한다.

### 애플리케이션

ASVS는 "애플리케이션"을 보안 제어 기능이 통합되어야 하는 개발 중인 소프트웨어 제품으로 정의한다. ASVS는 개발 수명 주기 활동을 규정하거나 CI/CD 파이프라인을 통해 애플리케이션이 구축되는 방식을 지시하지 않는다. 대신 제품 자체 내에서 달성해야 하는 보안 결과를 명시한다.

웹 애플리케이션 방화벽(Web Application Firewall; WAF), 로드 밸런서 또는 프록시와 같이 HTTP 트래픽을 처리, 수정 또는 검증하는 컴포넌트는 일부 보안 제어 기능이 해당 컴포넌트에 직접 의존하거나 해당 컴포넌트를 통해 구현될 수 있으므로 특정 목적을 위해 애플리케이션의 일부로 간주될 수 있다. 이러한 컴포넌트는 캐시된 응답, 속도 제한 또는 원본과 대상에 기반한 인바운드 및 아웃바운드 연결 제한과 관련된 요구사항에 대해 고려되어야 한다.

반대로 ASVS는 애플리케이션과 직접 관련이 없거나 구성이 애플리케이션의 책임 범위를 벗어나는 요구사항을 일반적으로 제외한다. 예를 들어, DNS 문제는 일반적으로 별도의 팀 또는 기능에 의해 관리된다.

마찬가지로, 애플리케이션이 입력을 소비하고 출력을 생성하는 방식에 대한 책임이 있지만, 외부 프로세스가 애플리케이션 또는 해당 데이터와 상호 작용하는 경우 ASVS의 범위를 벗어나는 것으로 간주된다. 예를 들어, 애플리케이션 또는 해당 데이터 백업은 일반적으로 외부 프로세스의 책임이며 애플리케이션 또는 개발자가 제어하지 않는다.

### 보안

모든 요구사항은 보안에 대해 입증 가능한 영향을 미쳐야 한다. 요구사항이 없으면 덜 안전한 애플리케이션이 될 수 있으며, 요구사항을 구현하면 보안 위험의 발생 가능성 또는 영향 중 하나를 줄여야 한다. 

기능적 측면, 코드 스타일 또는 정책 요구사항과 같은 다른 모든 고려 사항은 범위에 포함되지 않는다.

### 검증

해당 요구사항은 검증 가능해야 하며, 검증 결과는 "실패" 또는 "통과" 결정으로 이어져야 한다.

### 표준

ASVS는 표준을 준수하기 위해 구현되어야 하는 보안 요구사항의 모음으로 설계되었다. 이는 요구사항이 해당 보안 목표를 달성하기 위한 보안 목표 정의에 국한된다는 의미이다. 다른 관련 정보는 ASVS 위에 구축되거나 매핑을 통해 연결될 수 있다

특히 OWASP는 많은 프로젝트를 가지고 있으며, ASVS는 다른 프로젝트의 내용과 중복되는 것을 의도적으로 피한다. 예를 들어, 개발자는 "특정 기술 또는 환경에서 특정 요구사항을 어떻게 구현해야 하는가"라는 질문을 할 수 있으며, 이는 Cheat Sheet Series 프로젝트에서 다루어져야 한다. 검증자는 "이 환경에서 이 요구사항을 어떻게 테스트해야 하는가"라는 질문을 할 수 있으며, 이는 Web Security Testing Guide 프로젝트에서 다루어져야 한다.

ASVS는 보안 전문가만이 사용하도록 의도된 것은 아니지만, 독자가 내용을 이해하거나 특정 개념을 연구할 수 있는 기술적 지식을 갖출 것을 기대한다.

### 요구사항

"요구사항"이라는 단어는 ASVS에서 이를 충족하기 위해 무엇을 달성해야 하는지를 설명하므로 특별히 사용된다. ASVS는 주요 조건으로서 요구사항(must)만 포함하며 권고 사항(should)은 포함하지 않는다. 

다시 말해, 권고 사항은 문제를 해결하기 위한 여러 가능한 옵션 중 하나이거나 코드 스타일 고려 사항일지라도 요구사항의 정의를 충족하지 않는다. 

ASVS 요구사항은 구현이나 기술에 너무 구애받지 않으면서도 존재하는 이유를 자명하게 설명하면서 특정 보안 원칙을 다루도록 의도되었다. 이는 또한 요구사항이 특정 검증 방법이나 구현을 중심으로 구축되지 않음을 의미한다.

### Documented security decisions

In software security, planning security design and the mechanisms to be used early on will lead to a more consistent and reliable implementation in the finished product or feature.

Additionally, for certain requirements, implementation will be complicated and very specific to an application's needs. Common examples include permissions, input validation, and protective controls around different levels of sensitive data.

To account for this, rather than sweeping statements like "all data must be encrypted" or trying to cover every possible use case in a requirement, documentation requirements were included which mandate that the application developer's approach and configuration to these sorts of controls must be documented. This can then be reviewed for appropriateness and then the actual implementation can be compared to the documentation to assess whether the implementation matches expectations.

These requirements are intended to document the decisions which the organization developing the application has taken regarding how to implement certain security requirements.

Documentation requirements are always in the first section of a chapter (although not every chapter has them) and always have a related implementation requirement where the decisions that are documented should actually be put into place. The point here is that verifying that the documentation is in place and that the actual implementation are two separate activities.

There are two key drivers for including these requirements. The first driver is that a security requirement will often involve enforcing rules e.g., what kind of file types are allowed to be uploaded, what business controls should be enforced, what are the allowed characters for a particular field. These rules will differ for every application, and therefore, the ASVS cannot prescriptively define what they should be, nor will a cheat sheet or more detailed response help in this case. Similarly, without these decisions being documented, it will not be possible to perform verification of the requirements that implement these decisions.

The second driver is that for certain requirements, it is important to provide an application development with flexibility regarding how to address particular security challenges. For example, in previous ASVS versions, session timeout rules were very prescriptive. Practically speaking, many applications, especially those that are consumer-facing, have much more relaxed rules and prefer to implement other mitigation controls instead. Documentation requirements, therefore, explicitly allow for flexibility around this.

Clearly, it is not expected that individual developers will be making and documenting these decisions but rather the organization as a whole will be taking those decisions and making sure that they are communicated to developers who then make sure to follow them.

Providing developers with specifications and designs for new features and functionality is a standard part of software development. Similarly, developers are expected to use common components and user interface mechanisms rather than just making their own decisions each time. As such, extending this to security should not be seen as surprising or controversial.

There is also flexibility around how to achieve this. Security decisions might be documented in a literal document, which developers are expected to refer to. Alternatively, security decisions could be documented and implemented in a common code library that all developers are mandated to use. In both cases, the desired result is achieved.

## Application Security Verification Levels

The ASVS defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth and complexity. The general aim is for organizations to start with the first level to address the most critical security concerns, and then move up to the higher levels according to the organization and application needs. Levels may be presented as L1, L2, and L3 in the document and in requirement texts.

Each ASVS level indicates the security requirements that are required to achieve from that level, with the higher remaining level requirements as recommendations.

In order to avoid duplicate requirements or requirements that are no longer relevant at higher levels, some requirements apply to a particular level but have more stringent conditions for higher levels.

### Level evaluation

Levels are defined by priority-based evaluation of each requirement based on experience implementing and testing security requirements. The main focus is on comparing risk reduction with the effort to implement the requirement. Another key factor is to keep a low barrier to entry.

Risk reduction considers the extent to which the requirement reduces the level of security risk within the application, taking into account the classic Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact factors as well as considering whether this is a primary layer of defense or whether it would be considered defense in depth.

The rigorous discussions around both the criteria and the leveling decisions have resulted in an allocation which should hold true for the vast majority of cases, whilst accepting that it may not be a 100% fit for every situation. This means that in certain cases, organizations may wish to prioritize requirements from a higher level earlier on based on their own specific risk considerations.

The types of requirements in each level could be characterized as follows.

### Level 1

This level contains the minimum requirements to consider when securing an application and represents a critical starting point. This level contains around 20% of the ASVS requirements. The goal for this level is to have as few requirements as possible, to decrease the barrier to entry.

These requirements are generally critical or basic, first-layer of defense requirements for preventing common attacks that do not require other vulnerabilities or preconditions to be exploitable.

In addition to the first layer of defense requirements, some requirements have less of an impact at higher levels, such as requirements related to passwords. Those are more important for Level 1, as from higher levels, the multi-factor authentication requirements become relevant.

Level 1 is not necessarily penetration testable by an external tester without internal access to documentation or code (such as "black box" testing), although the lower number of requirements should make it easier to verify.

### Level 2

Most applications should be striving to achieve this level of security. Around 50% of the requirements in the ASVS are L2 meaning that an application needs to implement around 70% of the requirements in the ASVS (all of the L1 and L2 requirements) in order to comply with L2.

These requirements generally relate to either less common attacks or more complicated protections against common attacks. They may still be a first layer of defense, or they may require certain preconditions for the attack to be successful.

### Level 3

This level should be the goal for applications looking to demonstrate the highest levels of security and provides the final ~30% of requirements to comply with.

Requirements in this section are generally either defense-in-depth mechanisms or other useful but hard-to-implement controls.

### Which level to achieve

The priority-based levels are intended to provide a reflection of the application security maturity of the organization and the application. Rather than the ASVS prescriptively stating what level an application should be at, an organization should analyze its risks and decide what level it believes it should be at, depending on the sensitivity of the application and of course, the expectations of the application's users.

For example, an early-stage startup that is only collecting limited sensitive data may decide to focus on Level 1 for its initial security goals, but a bank may have difficulty justifying anything less than Level 3 to its customers for its online banking application.

## How to use the ASVS

### The structure of the ASVS

The ASVS is made up of a total of around 350 requirements which are divided into 17 chapters, each of which is further divided into sections.

The aim of the chapter and section division is to simplify choosing or filtering out chapters and sections based on the what is relevant for the application. For example, for a machine-to-machine API, the requirements in chapter V3 related to web frontends will not be relevant. If there is no use of OAuth or WebRTC, then those chapters can be ignored as well.

### Release strategy

ASVS releases follow the pattern "Major.Minor.Patch" and the numbers provide information on what has changed within the release. In a major release, the first number will change, in a minor release, the second number will change, and in a patch release, the third number will change.

* Major release - Full reorganization, almost everything may have changed, including requirement numbers. Reevaluation for compliance will be necessary (for example, 4.0.3 -> 5.0.0).
* Minor release - Requirements may be added or removed, but overall numbering will stay the same. Reevaluation for compliance will be necessary, but should be easier (for example, 5.0.0 -> 5.1.0).
* Patch release - Requirements may be removed (for example, if they are duplicates or outdated) or made less stringent, but an application that complied with the previous release will comply with the patch release as well (for example, 5.0.0 -> 5.0.1).

The above specifically relates to the requirements in the ASVS. Changes to surrounding text and other content such as the appendices will not be considered to be a breaking change.

### Flexibility with the ASVS

Several of the points described above, such as documentation requirements and the levels mechanism, provide the ability to use the ASVS in a more flexible and organization-specific way.

Additionally, organizations are strongly encouraged to create an organization- or domain-specific fork that adjusts requirements based on the specific characteristics and risk levels of their applications. However, it is important to maintain traceability so that passing requirement 4.1.1 means the same across all versions.

Ideally, each organization should create its own tailored ASVS, omitting irrelevant sections (e.g., GraphQL, WebSockets, SOAP, if unused). An organization-specific ASVS version or supplement is also a good place to provide organization-specific implementation guidance, detailing libraries or resources to use when complying with requirements.

### How to Reference ASVS Requirements

Each requirement has an identifier in the format `<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where each element is a number. For example, `1.11.3`.

* The `<chapter>` value corresponds to the chapter from which the requirement comes; for example, all `1.#.#` requirements are from the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter.
* The `<section>` value corresponds to the section within that chapter where the requirement appears, for example: all `1.2.#` requirements are in the 'Injection Prevention' section of the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter.
* The `<requirement>` value identifies the specific requirement within the chapter and section, for example, `1.2.5` which as of version 5.0.0 of this standard is:

> Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding.

Since the identifiers may change between versions of the standard, it is preferable for other documents, reports, or tools to use the following format: `v<version>-<chapter>.<section>.<requirement>`, where: 'version' is the ASVS version tag. For example: `v5.0.0-1.2.5` would be understood to mean specifically the 5th requirement in the 'Injection Prevention' section of the 'Encoding and Sanitization' chapter from version 5.0.0. (This could be summarized as `v<version>-<requirement_identifier>`.)

Note: The `v` preceding the version number in the format should always be lowercase.

If identifiers are used without including the `v<version>` element then they should be assumed to refer to the latest Application Security Verification Standard content. As the standard grows and changes this becomes problematic, which is why writers or developers should include the version element.

ASVS requirement lists are made available in CSV, JSON, and other formats which may be useful for reference or programmatic use.

### Forking the ASVS

Organizations can benefit from adopting ASVS by choosing one of the three levels or by creating a domain-specific fork that adjusts requirements per application risk level. This type of fork is encouraged, provided that it maintains traceability so that passing requirement 4.1.1 means the same across all versions.

Ideally, each organization should create its own tailored ASVS, omitting irrelevant sections (e.g., GraphQL, Websockets, SOAP, if unused). Forking should start with ASVS Level 1 as a baseline, advancing to Levels 2 or 3 based on the application’s risk.

## Use cases for the ASVS

The ASVS can be used to assess the security of an application and this is explored in more depth in the next chapter. However, several other potential uses for the ASVS (or a forked version) have been identified.

### As Detailed Security Architecture Guidance

One of the more common uses for the Application Security Verification Standard is as a resource for security architects. There are limited resources available for how to build a secure application architecture, especially with modern applications. ASVS can be used to fill in those gaps by allowing security architects to choose better controls for common problems, such as data protection patterns and input validation strategies. The architecture and documentation requirements will be particularly useful for this.

### As a Specialized Secure Coding Reference

The ASVS can be used as a basis for preparing a secure coding reference during application development, helping developers to make sure that they keep security in mind when they build software. Whilst the ASVS can be the base, organizations should prepare their own specific guidance which is clear and unified and ideally be prepared based on guidance from security engineers or security architects. As an extension to this, organizations are encouraged wherever possible to prepare approved security mechanisms and libraries that can be referenced in the guidance and used by developers.

### As a Guide for Automated Unit and Integration Tests

The ASVS is designed to be highly testable. Some verifications will be technical where as other requirements (such as the architectural and documentation requirements) may require documentation or architecture review. By building unit and integration tests that test and fuzz for specific and relevant abuse cases related to the requirements that are verifiable by technical means, it should be easier to check that these controls are operating correctly on each build. For example, additional tests can be crafted for the test suite for a login controller, testing the username parameter for common default usernames, account enumeration, brute forcing, LDAP and SQL injection, and XSS. Similarly, a test on the password parameter should include common passwords, password length, null byte injection, removing the parameter, XSS, and more.

### For Secure Development Training

ASVS can also be used to define the characteristics of secure software. Many “secure coding” courses are simply ethical hacking courses with a light smear of coding tips. This may not necessarily help developers to write more secure code. Instead, secure development courses can use the ASVS with a strong focus on the positive mechanisms found in the ASVS, rather than the Top 10 negative things not to do. The ASVS structure also provides a logical structure for walking through the different topics when securing an application.

### As a Framework for Guiding the Procurement of Secure Software

The ASVS is a great framework to help with secure software procurement or procurement of custom development services. The buyer can simply set a requirement that the software they wish to procure must be developed at ASVS level X, and request that the seller proves that the software satisfies ASVS level X.

## Applying ASVS in Practice

Different threats have different motivations. Some industries have unique information and technology assets and domain-specific regulatory compliance requirements.

Organizations are strongly encouraged to look deeply at their unique risk characteristics based on the nature of their business, and based upon that risk and business requirements determine the appropriate ASVS level.
