# Preface

Welcome to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Version 5.0.

## Introduction

Originally launched in 2008 through a global community collaboration, the ASVS defines a comprehensive set of security requirements for designing, developing, and testing modern web applications and services.

Following the release of ASVS 4.0 in 2019 and its minor update (v4.0.3) in 2021, Version 5.0 represents a significant milestoneâ€”modernized to reflect the latest advances in software security.

ASVS 5.0 is the result of extensive contributions from project leaders, working group members, and the wider OWASP community to update and improve this important standard.

## Principles behind version 5.0

This major revision has been developed with several key principles in mind:

* Refined Scope and Focus: This version of the standard has been designed to align more directly with the foundational pillars in its name: Application, Security, Verification, and Standard. Requirements have been rewritten to emphasize the prevention of security flaws rather than mandating specific technical implementations. Requirement texts are intended to be self-explanatory, explaining why they exist.

* Support for Documented Security Decisions: ASVS 5.0 introduces requirements for documenting key security decisions. This enhances traceability and supports context-sensitive implementations, allowing organizations to tailor their security posture to their specific needs and risks.

* Updated Levels: While ASVS retains its three-tier model, the level definitions have evolved to make the ASVS easier to adopt. Level 1 is designed as the initial step to adopting the ASVS, providing the first layer of defense. Level 2 represents a comprehensive view of standard security practices, and Level 3 addresses advanced, high-assurance requirements.

* Restructured and Expanded Content: ASVS 5.0 includes approximately 350 requirements across 17 chapters. Chapters have been reorganized for clarity and usability. A two-way mapping between v4.0 and v5.0 is provided to facilitate migration.

## Looking ahead

Just as securing an application is never truly finished, neither is the ASVS. Although Version 5.0 is a major release, development continues. This release allows the wider community to benefit from the improvements and additions which have been accumulated but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements. This could include community-driven efforts to create implementation and verification guidance built on top of the core requirement set.

ASVS 5.0 is designed to serve as a reliable foundation for secure software development. The community is invited to adopt, contribute, and build upon this standard to collectively advance the state of application security.
