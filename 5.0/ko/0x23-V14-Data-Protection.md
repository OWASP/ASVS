# V14 Data Protection

## Control Objective

Applications cannot account for all usage patterns and user behaviors, and should therefore implement controls to limit unauthorized access to sensitive data on client devices.

This chapter includes requirements related to defining what data needs to be protected, how it should be protected, and specific mechanisms to implement or pitfalls to avoid.

Another consideration for data protection is bulk extraction, modification, or excessive usage. Each system's requirements are likely to be very different, so determining what is "abnormal" must consider the threat model and business risk. From an ASVS perspective, detecting these issues is handled in the "Security Logging and Error Handling" chapter, and setting limits is handled in the "Validation and Business Logic" chapter.

## V14.1 Data Protection Documentation

A key prerequisite for being able to protect data is to categorize what data should be considered sensitive. There are likely to be several different levels of sensitivity, and for each level, the controls required to protect data at that level will be different.

There are various privacy regulations and laws that affect how applications must approach the storage, use, and transmission of sensitive personal information. This section no longer tries to duplicate these types of data protection or privacy legislation, but rather focuses on key technical considerations for protecting sensitive data. Please consult local laws and regulations, and consult a qualified privacy specialist or lawyer as required.

| # | Description | Level |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **14.1.1** | Verify that all sensitive data created and processed by the application has been identified and classified into protection levels. This includes data that is only encoded and therefore easily decoded, such as Base64 strings or the plaintext payload inside a JWT. Protection levels need to take into account any data protection and privacy regulations and standards which the application is required to comply with. | 2 |
| **14.1.2** | Verify that all sensitive data protection levels have a documented set of protection requirements. This must include (but not be limited to) requirements related to general encryption, integrity verification, retention, how the data is to be logged, access controls around sensitive data in logs, database-level encryption, privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies to be used, and other confidentiality requirements. | 2 |

## V14.2 General Data Protection

This section contains various practical requirements related to the protection of data. Most are specific to particular issues such as unintended data leakage, but there is also a general requirement to implement protection controls based on the protection level required for each data item.

| # | Description | Level |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **14.2.1** | Verify that sensitive data is only sent to the server in the HTTP message body or header fields, and that the URL and query string do not contain sensitive information, such as an API key or session token. | 1 |
| **14.2.2** | Verify that the application prevents sensitive data from being cached in server components, such as load balancers and application caches, or ensures that the data is securely purged after use. | 2 |
| **14.2.3** | Verify that defined sensitive data is not sent to untrusted parties (e.g., user trackers) to prevent unwanted collection of data outside of the application's control. | 2 |
| **14.2.4** | Verify that controls around sensitive data related to encryption, integrity verification, retention, how the data is to be logged, access controls around sensitive data in logs, privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies, are implemented as defined in the documentation for the specific data's protection level. | 2 |
| **14.2.5** | Verify that caching mechanisms are configured to only cache responses which have the expected content type for that resource and do not contain sensitive, dynamic content. The web server should return a 404 or 302 response when a non-existent file is accessed rather than returning a different, valid file. This should prevent Web Cache Deception attacks. | 3 |
| **14.2.6** | Verify that the application only returns the minimum required sensitive data for the application's functionality. For example, only returning some of the digits of a credit card number and not the full number. If the complete data is required, it should be masked in the user interface unless the user specifically views it. | 3 |
| **14.2.7** | Verify that sensitive information is subject to data retention classification, ensuring that outdated or unnecessary data is deleted automatically, on a defined schedule, or as the situation requires. | 3 |
| **14.2.8** | Verify that sensitive information is removed from the metadata of user-submitted files unless storage is consented to by the user. | 3 |

## V14.3 Client-side Data Protection

This section contains requirements preventing data from leaking in specific ways at the client or user agent side of an application.

| # | Description | Level |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| **14.3.1** | Verify that authenticated data is cleared from client storage, such as the browser DOM, after the client or session is terminated. The 'Clear-Site-Data' HTTP response header field may be able to help with this but the client-side should also be able to clear up if the server connection is not available when the session is terminated. | 1 |
| **14.3.2** | Verify that the application sets sufficient anti-caching HTTP response header fields (i.e., Cache-Control: no-store) so that sensitive data is not cached in browsers. | 2 |
| **14.3.3** | Verify that data stored in browser storage (such as localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, or cookies) does not contain sensitive data, with the exception of session tokens. | 2 |
