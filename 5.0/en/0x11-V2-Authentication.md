# V2 Authentication

## Control Objective

Authentication is the process of establishing or confirming the authenticity of an individual or device. It involves verifying claims made by a person or about a device, ensuring resistance to impersonation, and preventing the recovery or interception of passwords.

Adoption of effective, evidence-based leading practice will be challenging for many, and that's perfectly okay. We have to start the transition to a post-password future now.

## NIST SP 800-63 - Modern, evidence-based authentication standard

[NIST SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) is a modern, evidence-based standard, and represents the best advice available, regardless of applicability. The standard is helpful for all organizations all over the world but is particularly relevant to US agencies and those dealing with US agencies.

NIST SP 800-63 terminology can be a little confusing and we have tried to standardise the terminology to optimize for clarity, using more commonly understood terminology where possible.

As such, whilst this chapter aligns to a subset of selected NIST SP 800-63B controls, we have focused on common threats and frequently exploited authentication weaknesses. For cases where full NIST SP 800-63 compliance is necessary, please refer to NIST SP 800-63.

We strongly urge US government agencies to review and implement NIST SP 800-63 in its entirety.

## V1.2 Authentication Documentation

<!--
When designing authentication systems, the strength of hardware-enabled multi-factor authentication becomes irrelevant if an attacker can easily reset an account by calling a call center and answering commonly known questions. To ensure secure identity verification, all authentication pathways must possess equivalent strength.

## V2.1 Password Security

Passwords, called "Memorized Secrets" by NIST SP 800-63, include passwords, PINs, unlock patterns, pick the correct kitten or another image element, and passphrases. They are generally considered "something you know", and often used as single-factor authentication mechanism. There are significant challenges to the continued use of single-factor authentication, including billions of valid usernames and passwords disclosed on the Internet, default or weak passwords, rainbow tables and ordered dictionaries of the most common passwords.

Applications should strongly encourage users to enroll in multi-factor authentication and should allow users to re-use tokens they already possess, such as FIDO or U2F tokens, or link to a credential service provider that provides multi-factor authentication.

Credential Service Providers (CSPs) provide federated identity for users. Users will often have more than one identity with multiple CSPs, such as an enterprise identity using Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity or Google, or consumer identity using Facebook, Twitter, Google, or WeChat, to name just a few common alternatives. This list is not an endorsement of these companies or services, but simply an encouragement for developers to consider the reality that many users have many established identities. Organizations should consider integrating with existing user identities, as per the risk profile of the CSP's strength of identity proofing. For example, it is unlikely a government organization would accept a social media identity as a login for sensitive systems, as it is easy to create fake or throw away identities, whereas a mobile game company may well need to integrate with major social media platforms to grow their active player base.

The requirements in this section mostly relate to section [5.1.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

## V2.2 General Authentication Security

Authentication factor agility is essential to future-proof applications. Applications should allow additional secure authentication factors to be used, as per user preferences, as well as retiring deprecated or unsafe authentication mechanisms in an orderly fashion.

NIST considers SMS as a ["restricted" authentication mechanism](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b01), and it is likely to be removed from NIST SP 800-63, and consequently from the ASVS, in the future. As at the time of writing this has still not yet happened but applications should plan a roadmap that does not require the use of SMS.

NIST SP 800-63 considers email as [not acceptable](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b11) as an authentication mechanism.

The requirements in this section relate to a variety of sections of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), including: 4.2.1, 4.3.1, 5.2.2, and 6.1.2.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |

| **2.2.8** | [ADDED] Verify that valid users cannot be deduced from failed authentication challenges, such as by basing on error messages, HTTP response codes, or different response times. Registration and forgot password functionality should also have this protection. | | | ✓ | |
| **2.2.9** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 2.2.4] Verify that the application requires users to either use a multi-factor authentication mechanism or a requires a combination of single-factor authentication mechanisms. | | ✓ | ✓ | 308 |
| **2.2.10** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 2.2.3] Verify that users are notified of suspicious authentication attempts. This may include successful or unsuccessful authentication from an unusual location or client, partially successful authentication with only one of multiple factors, successful or unsuccessful authentication after a long period of inactivity or successful authentication after several unsuccessful attempts. | | ✓ | ✓ | 778 |
| **2.2.11** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 1.2.4] Verify that, if the application includes multiple authentication pathways, there are no undocumented pathways and that security controls and authentication strength are enforced consistently. | | ✓ | ✓ | 306 |

## V2.3 Authentication Factor Lifecycle

Authentication mechanisms can involve passwords, soft tokens, hardware tokens, and biometric devices. The lifecycle of these authentication mechanisms is critical to the security of an application - if anyone can self-register an account with no evidence of identity, there can be little trust in the identity assertion. For social media sites like Reddit, that's perfectly okay. For banking systems, a greater focus on the registration and issuance of credentials and devices is critical to the security of the application.

Note: Passwords are not to have a maximum lifetime or be subject to password rotation. Passwords should be checked for being breached, not regularly replaced.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2.3.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that system generated initial passwords or activation codes are securely randomly generated, follow the existing password policy, and expire after a short period of time or after they are initially used. These initial secrets must not be permitted to become the long term password. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 330 |
| **2.3.2** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 2.2.4] | | | | |
| **2.3.3** | [MODIFIED] Verify that renewal instructions for authentication mechanisms which expire are sent with enough time to be carried out before the old authentication mechanism expires, configuring automated reminders if necessary. | | ✓ | ✓ | 287 |
| **2.3.4** | [ADDED] Verify that administrative users can initiate the password reset process for the user, but that this does not allow them to change or choose the user's password. This prevents a situation where they know the user's password. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 620 |

## V2.4 Credential Storage

Architects and developers should adhere to this section when building or refactoring code.

The current list of approved password hashing algorithms is detailed in NIST SP 800-63B section 5.1.1.2, and in the [OWASP Password Storage Cheatsheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#password-hashing-algorithms). Pay careful attention to the configuration guidance to be aware of any implementation challenges or limits with each algorithm. At time of writing, Argon2id is the prefered password hashing algorithm, based on its resistance to side-channel attacks and its customizable memory, CPU, and parallelism parameters.

In particular, note that since these algorithms are intentionally compute-intensive, there have been cases in the past where providing a very long password leads to a denial of service condition. It is therefore very important to protect against this.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

## V2.5 Credential Recovery

The requirements in this section mostly relate to section [5.1.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver) or [6.1.2.3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#replacement) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |

| **2.5.7** | [GRAMMAR, LEVEL L2 > L1] Verify that if OTP or other multi-factor authentication factors are lost, that evidence of identity proofing is performed at the same level as during enrollment. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 308 |

## V2.6 Lookup Secrets

Lookup secrets are pre-generated lists of secret codes, similar to Transaction Authorization Numbers (TAN), social media recovery codes, or a grid containing a set of random values. These are distributed securely to users. These lookup codes are single-use. Once all are utilized, the lookup secret list is discarded. This type of authentication mechanism is considered "something you have".

The requirements in this section mostly relate to section [5.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#-512-look-up-secrets) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **2.6.1** | Verify that lookup secrets can be used only once. | | ✓ | ✓ | 308 |
| **2.6.2** | [MODIFIED, SPLIT TO 2.6.4] Verify that, when being stored in the application's back-end, lookup secrets with less than 112 bits of entropy (19 random alphanumeric characters or 34 random digits) are hashed with an approved password storage hashing algorithm that incorporates a 32-bit random salt. A standard hash function can be used if the secret has 112 bits of entropy or more. | | ✓ | ✓ | 330 |
| **2.6.3** | [MODIFIED] Verify that lookup secrets are generated using a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG) to avoid predictable values. | | ✓ | ✓ | 310 |
| **2.6.4** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 2.6.2] Verify that lookup secrets have a minimum of 20 bits of entropy (typically 4 random alphanumeric characters or 6 random digits is sufficient). | | ✓ | ✓ | 330 |

## V2.7 Out-of-Band authentication mechanisms

In the past, a common out-of-band authentication mechanism would have been an email or SMS containing a password reset link. Attackers use this weak mechanism to reset accounts they don't yet control, such as taking over a person's email account and re-using any discovered reset links. There are better ways to handle out-of-band verification.

Secure out-of-band authentication mechanisms will generally involve the authentication server communicating with a physical device over a secure secondary channel. Examples include push notifications to mobile devices. This type of authentication mechanism is considered "something you have".

The communication may includes an authentication code, typically a random number/code (which will get sent back as confirmation via the primary channel), or feature some form of approval dialog. The authentication server waits to receive the confirmation and if it is received correctly can consider authenticated to have succeeded.

The ASVS assumes that few developers will be developing new types of out-of-band authentication mechanism but rather will be utilizing existing types. As such, the following ASVS requirements focus on existing mechanisms. If developing a new type of out-of-band mechanism, please refer to NIST SP 800-63B &sect; 5.1.3.1.

Unsafe out-of-band authentication mechanisms such as e-mail and VOIP are not permitted. PSTN and SMS authentication are currently "restricted" by NIST and should be deprecated in favor of push notifications or similar. If you need to use telephone or SMS out-of-band authentication, please see NIST SP 800-63B &sect; 5.1.3.3.

The requirements in this section mostly relate to section [5.1.3](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#-513-out-of-band-devices) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).

| **2.7.5** | [DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT] | | | | |
| **2.7.6** | [MODIFIED] Verify that codes used in out-of-band authentication are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) and contain at least 20 bits of entropy (typically 4 random alphanumeric characters or 6 random digits is sufficient). | | ✓ | ✓ | 310 |
| **2.7.7** | [ADDED] Verify that a code based out-of-band authentication mechanism is protected against brute force attacks by using either rate limiting or a code with at least 64 bits of entropy. | | ✓ | ✓ | 307 |
| **2.7.8** | [ADDED] Verify that, where push notifications are used for multi-factor authentication, rate limiting or number matching is used to prevent push bombing attacks. | | | ✓ | |

## V2.8 Time based One-time Passwords

Single-factor, time-based, one-time passwords (TOTPs) are physical or soft tokens that display a continually changing pseudo-random one-time challenge. This type of authentication mechanism is considered "something you have".

Multi-factor TOTPs are similar to single-factor TOTPs, but require a valid PIN code, biometric unlocking, USB insertion or NFC pairing or some additional value (such as transaction signing calculators) to be entered to create the final OTP.

The requirements in this section relate to a variety of sections of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html), including: 5.1.4.2, 5.1.5.2, 5.2.1, and 5.2.3.

| **2.8.7** | [MODIFIED, LEVEL L2 > L3] Verify that biometric authentication mechanisms are only used as secondary factors together with either something you have or something you know. | | | ✓ | 308 |
| **2.8.8** | [ADDED] Ensure that generation of the time-based multi-factor OTP token is based on the server's system time and not the client's machine. | | | ✓ | 367 |

## V2.9 Cryptographic authentication mechanism

Cryptographic authentication mechanism include smart cards or FIDO keys, where the user has to plug in or pair the cryptographic device to the computer to complete authentication. The authenticatoin server will send a challenge nonce to the cryptographic device or software, and the device or software calculates a response based upon a securely stored cryptographic key.

The requirements for single-factor cryptographic devices and software, and multi-factor cryptographic devices and software are the same, as verification of the cryptographic device proves possession of the authentication factor.

The requirements in this section mostly relate to section [5.1.7.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sfcdv) of [NIST's Guidance](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).
