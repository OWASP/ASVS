# Appendix C: Cryptography Standards

The "Cryptography" chapter goes beyond simply defining best practices. It aims to enhance understanding of cryptography principles and encourage the adoption of more resilient, modern security methods. This appendix provides detailed technical information regarding each requirement, complementing the overarching standards outlined in the "Cryptography" chapter.

This appendix defines the level of approval for different cryptographic mechanisms:

* Approved (A) mechanisms can be used in applications.
* Legacy mechanisms (L) should not be used in applications but might still be used for compatibility with existing legacy applications or code only. While the usage of such these mechanisms is currently not considered to be a vulnerability in itself, they should be replaced by more secure and future-proof mechanisms as soon as possible.
* Disallowed mechanisms (D) must not be used because they are currently considered broken or do not provide sufficient security.

This list may be overridden in the context of a given application for various reasons including:

* new evolutions in the field of cryptography;
* compliance with regulation.

## Cryptographic Inventory and Documentation

This section provides additional information
for V11.1 Cryptographic Inventory and Documentation.

It is important to ensure that all cryptographic assets, such as algorithms, keys, and certificates, are regularly discovered, inventoried, and assessed. For Level 3, this should include the use of static and dynamic scanning to discover the use of cryptography in an application. Tools such as SAST and DAST may help with this but it is possible that dedicated tools would be needed to get more comprehensive coverage. Freeware examples of tools include:

* [CryptoMon - Network Cryptography Monitor - using eBPF, written in python](https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/CryptoMon)
* [Cryptobom Forge Tool: Generating Comprehensive CBOMs from CodeQL Outputs](https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/cryptobom-forge)

## Equivalent Strengths of Cryptographic Parameters

The relative security strengths for various cryptographic systems are in this table (from [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final), p.71):

| Security Strength | Symmetric Key Algorithms | Finite Field | Integer Factorization | Elliptic Curve |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| <= 80 | 2TDEA | L = 1024 <br> N = 160 | k = 1024 | f = 160-223 |
| 112 | 3TDEA   | L = 2048 <br> N = 224 | k = 2048 | f = 224-255 |
| 128 | AES-128 | L = 3072 <br> N = 256 | k = 3072 | f = 256-383 |
| 192 | AES-192 | L = 7680 <br> N = 384 | k = 7680 | f = 384-511 |
| 256 | AES-256 | L = 15360 <br> N = 512 | k = 15360 | f = 512+ |

Example of applications:

* Finite Field Cryptography: DSA, FFDH, MQV
* Integer Factorization Cryptography: RSA
* Elliptic Curve Cryptography: ECDSA, EdDSA, ECDH, MQV

Note: that this section assumes that no quantum computer exists; if such a computer would exist, the estimates for the last 3 columns would be no longer valid.

for V11.3 Encryption Algorithms.

Approved cipher algorithms are listed in order of preference.

### AES Cipher Modes

Block ciphers, such as AES, can be used with different modes of operations. Many modes of operations, such as Electronic codebook (ECB), are insecure and must not be used. The Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and Counter with cipher block chaining message authentication code (CCM) modes of operations provide authenticated encryption and should be used in modern applications.

Approved modes are listed in order of preference.

| Mode | Authenticated | Reference | Status | Restriction |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| GCM | Yes | [NIST SP 800-38D](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/d/final) | A | |
| CCM | Yes | [NIST SP 800-38C](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/c/upd1/final) | A | |
| CBC | No | [NIST SP 800-38A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/a/final) | L | |
| CCM-8 | Yes | | D | |
| ECB | No | | D | |
| CFB | No | | D | |
| OFB | No | | D | |
| CTR | No | | D | |

Notes:

* All encrypted messages must be authenticated. For ANY use of CBC mode there MUST be an associated hashing MAC algorithm to validate the message. In general, this MUST be applied in the Encrypt-Then-Hash method (but TLS 1.2 uses Hash-Then-Encrypt instead). If this cannot be guaranteed, then CBC MUST NOT be used. The only application where encryption without a MAC algorithm is allowed is disk encryption.
* If CBC is used, it shall be guaranteed that the verification of the padding is performed in constant time.
* When using CCM-8, the MAC tag only has 64 bits of security. This does not conform to requirement 6.2.9 which requires at least 128 bits of security.
* Disk encryption is considered out of scope for the ASVS. Therefore this appendix does not list any approved method for disk encryption. For this usage, encryption without authentication is usually accepted and the XTS, XEX and LRW modes are typically used.

### Key Wrapping

Cryptographic key wrap (and corresponding key unwrap) is a method of protecting an existing key by encapsulating (i.e., wrapping) it by employing an additional encryption mechanism so that the original key is not obviously exposed, e.g., during a transfer. This additional key used to protect the original key is referred to as the wrap key.

This operation may be performed when it is desirable to protect keys in places deemed untrustworthy, or to send sensitive keys over untrusted networks or within applications.
However, serious consideration should be given to understanding the nature (e.g., the identity and the purpose) of the original key prior to committing to a wrap/unwrap procedure as this may have repercussions for both source and target systems/applications in terms of security and especially compliance which may include audit trails of a key's function (e.g., signing) as well as appropriate key storage.

Specifically, AES-256 MUST be used for key wrapping, following [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) and considering forward-looking provisions against the quantum threat. Cipher modes using AES are the following, in order of preference:

| Key Wrapping | Reference | Status |
|--|--|--|
| KW | [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) | A |
| KWP | [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) | A |

AES-192 and AES-128 MAY be used if the use case demands it, but its motivation MUST be documented in the entity's cryptography inventory.

### Authenticated Encryption

With the exception of disk encryption, encrypted data must be protected against unauthorized modification using some form of authenticated encryption (AE) scheme, usually using an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) scheme.

The application should preferably use an approved AEAD scheme. It might alternatively combine an approved cipher scheme and an approved MAC algorithm with a Encrypt-then-MAC construct.

MAC-then-encrypt is still allowed for compatibility with legacy applications. It is used in TLS v1.2 with old ciphers suites.

## Hash Functions

This section provides additional information
for V11.4 Hashing and Hash-based Functions.

### Hash Functions for General Use Cases

The following table lists hash functions approved in general cryptographic use cases such as digital signatures:

* Approved hash functions provide strong collision resistance and are suitable for high-security applications.
* Some of these algorithms offer strong resistance to attacks when used with proper cryptographic key management, and so are additionally approved for HMAC, KDF, and RBG functions.
* Hash function with less than 254 bit of output have insufficient collision resistance and must not be used for digital signature or other applications requiring collision resistance. For other usages, they might be used for compatibility and verification ONLY with legacy systems but must not be used in new designs.

## Key Exchange Mechanisms

This section provides additional information
for V11.6 Public Key Cryptography.

### KEX Schemes

A security strength of 112 bits or above MUST be ensured for all Key Exchange schemes, and their implementation MUST follow the parameter choices in the following table.

| Scheme | Domain Parameters | Forward Secrecy |Status |
|--|--|--|--|
| Finite Field Diffie-Hellman (FFDH) | L >= 3072 & N >= 256 | Yes | A |
| Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) | f >= 256-383 | Yes | A |
| Encrypted key transport with RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 | | No | D |

Where the following parameters are:

* k is the key size for RSA keys.
* L is the size of the public key and N is the size of the private key for finite field cryptography.
* f is the range of key sizes for ECC.

Any new implementation MUST NOT use any scheme that is NOT compliant with [NIST SP 800-56A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/56/a/r3/final) & [B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/56/b/r2/final) and [NIST SP 800-77](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/77/r1/final). Specifically, IKEv1 MUST NOT be used in production.

### Diffie-Hellman groups

The following groups are approved for implementations of Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Security strengths are documented in [NIST SP 800-56A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/56/a/r3/final), Appendix D, and [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev.5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final).

## Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are cryptographic constructs used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. A MAC takes a message and a secret key as inputs and produces a fixed-size tag (the MAC value). MACs are widely used in secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to ensure that messages exchanged between parties are authentic and intact.

## Digital Signatures

Signature schemes MUST use approved key sizes and parameters per [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final).

## Post-Quantum Encryption Standards

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) implementations should follow [FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd), [FIPS-204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd), and [FIPS-205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/ipd). At this time, there are not many hardened code examples or reference implementations available for these standards. For further details, see the [NIST announcement of the first three finalized post-quantum encryption standards (August 2024)](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards).

The proposed [mlkem768x25519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem/03/) post-quantum hybrid TLS key agreement method is supported by major browsers such as [Firefox release 132](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/132.0/releasenotes/) and [Chrome release 131](https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/a-new-path-for-kyber-on-web.html). It may be used in cryptographic testing environments or when available within industry- or government-approved libraries.
