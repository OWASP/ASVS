# V6 Cryptography

## Control Objective

The objective of V6 is to define best practices for the general use of cryptography but also to instill a fundamental understanding of cryptographic principles and inspire a shift toward more resilient and modern approaches. It encourages doing the following:

* Implementing robust cryptographic systems that fail securely, adapt to evolving threats, and are future-proof.
* Utilizing cryptographic mechanisms that are both secure and aligned with industry best practices.
* Maintaining a secure cryptographic key management system with appropriate access controls and auditing.
* Regularly evaluating the cryptographic landscape to assess new risks and adapt algorithms accordingly.
* Discovering and managing cryptographic use cases throughout the application's lifecycle to ensure that all cryptographic assets are accounted for and secured.

In addition to outlining general principles and best practices, this document also provides more in-depth technical information about the requirements in [Appendix V](./0x97-Appendix-V_Cryptography.md).

Requirements which use cryptography to solve a separate problem, such as secrets management or communications security, will be in different parts of the standard.

## V1.6 Cryptographic Inventory and Documentation

Applications need to be designed with strong cryptographic architecture to protect data assets as per their classification. Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high-level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.

Architectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integration test. Architectural requirements require consideration in coding standards, throughout the coding phase, and should be reviewed during security architecture, peer or code reviews, or retrospectives.

It is also important to ensure that all cryptographic assets, such as algorithms, keys, and certificates, are regularly discovered, inventoried, and assessed. For Level 3, this should include the use of static and dynamic scanning to discover the use of cryptography in an application. Tools such as SAST and DAST may help with this but it is possible that dedicated tools would be needed to get more comprehensive coverage. Freeware examples of tools include:

* [CryptoMon - Network Cryptography Monitor - using eBPF, written in python](https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/CryptoMon)
* [Cryptobom Forge Tool: Generating Comprehensive CBOMs from CodeQL Outputs](https://github.com/Santandersecurityresearch/cryptobom-forge)

## V6.2 Algorithms

Recent advances in cryptography mean that previously safe algorithms and key lengths are no longer safe or sufficient to protect data. Therefore, it should be possible to change algorithms.

Although this section is not easily penetration tested, developers should consider this entire section as mandatory even though L1 is missing from most of the items.

## V6.3 Random Values

Cryptographically secure Pseudo-random Number Generation (CSPRNG) is incredibly difficult to get right. Generally, good sources of entropy within a system will be quickly depleted if over-used, but sources with less randomness can lead to predictable keys and secrets.

## V6.6 Hashing and Hash-based Functions

Cryptographic hashes are used in a wide variety of cryptographic protocols, such as digital signatures, HMAC, key derivation functions (KDF), random bit generation, and password storage. The security of the cryptographic system is only as strong as the underlying hash functions used. This section outlines the requirements for using secure hash functions in cryptographic operations.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

## V6.7 Key Exchange Mechanisms

There exists a need for approved key exchange mechanisms, such as Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) to ensure that the cryptosystem remains secure against modern threats.

This should prevent attacks on the key establishment process which could lead to adversary-in-the-middle attacks or cryptographic breaks. | | ✓ | ✓ | |

## V6.8 In-Use Data Cryptography

Protecting data while it is being processed is paramount. Techniques such as full memory encryption, encryption of data in transit, and ensuring data is encrypted as quickly as possible after use is recommended.
