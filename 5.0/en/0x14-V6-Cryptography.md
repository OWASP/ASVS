# V6 Stored Cryptography

## Control Objective

The objective of V6 is not only to define best practices but also to instill a fundamental understanding of cryptographic principles and inspire a shift toward more resilient and modern approaches by doing the following:

* Implementing robust cryptographic systems that fail securely, adapt to evolving threats, and are future-proof.
* Utilizing cryptographic mechanisms that are both secure and aligned with industry best practices.
* Maintaining a secure cryptographic key management system with appropriate access controls and auditing.
* Regularly evaluating the cryptographic landscape to assess new risks and adapt algorithms accordingly.
* Discovering and managing cryptographic use cases throughout the application's lifecycle to ensure that all cryptographic assets are accounted for and secured.

## V1.6 Cryptographic Inventory and Documentation

Applications need to be designed with strong cryptographic architecture to protect data assets as per their classification. Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high-level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.

Architectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integration test. Architectural requirements require consideration in coding standards, throughout the coding phase, and should be reviewed during security architecture, peer or code reviews, or retrospectives.

It is also important to ensure that all cryptographic assets, such as algorithms, keys, and certificates, are regularly discovered, inventoried, and assessed.

Recent advances in cryptography mean that previously safe algorithms and key lengths are no longer safe or sufficient to protect data. Therefore, it should be possible to change algorithms.

Although this section is not easily penetration tested, developers should consider this entire section as mandatory even though L1 is missing from most of the items.

The relative security strengths for various cryptographic systems are in this table (from [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final), p.71):

## V6.3 Random Values

Cryptographically secure Pseudo-random Number Generation (CSPRNG) is incredibly difficult to get right. Generally, good sources of entropy within a system will be quickly depleted if over-used, but sources with less randomness can lead to predictable keys and secrets.

## V6.6 Hashing and Hash-based Functions

Cryptographic hashes are used in a wide variety of cryptographic protocols, such as digital signatures, HMAC, key derivation functions (KDF), random bit generation, and password storage. The security of the cryptographic system is only as strong as the underlying hash functions used. This section outlines the requirements for using secure hash functions in cryptographic operations.

The following hash functions are approved for use in general cryptographic use cases such as digital signatures, HMAC, key derivation functions (KDF), and random bit generation (RBG). These functions provide strong collision resistance and are suitable for high-security applications. Some of these algorithms offer strong resistance to attacks when used with proper cryptographic key management, and so are additionally approved for HMAC, KDF, and RBG functions.

| **6.8.1** | [ADDED] Verify that full memory encryption is in use that protects sensitive data while it is in use, preventing access by unauthorized users or processes. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |
| **6.8.2** | [ADDED] Verify that data minimization ensures the minimal amount of data is exposed during processing, and ensure that data is encrypted immediately after use or as soon as feasible. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |

## V6.9 Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

The need to future-proof cryptographic systems in preparation for the eventual rise of quantum computing is critical. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) focuses on developing cryptographic systems that are resistant to quantum attacks, which could break current encryption methods such as RSA and ECC.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **6.9.1** | [ADDED] Verify that Quantum-Safe Algorithms, or quantum-resistant algorithms, such as lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, or multivariate cryptographic schemes, as replacements for vulnerable classical algorithms like RSA and ECC, are used. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |
| **6.9.2** | [ADDED] Verify that cryptographic systems are designed to allow for seamless upgrades to post-quantum cryptography, enabling the transition once PQC standards are fully established. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |
| **6.9.3** | [ADDED] Regularly monitor advancements in the field of post-quantum cryptography and align with emerging industry standards to remain prepared for quantum threats. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |
