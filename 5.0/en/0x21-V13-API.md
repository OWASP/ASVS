# V13 API and Web Service

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified application that uses trusted service layer APIs (commonly using JSON or XML or GraphQL) has:

* Adequate authentication, session management and authorization of all web services.
* Input validation of all parameters that transit from a lower to higher trust level.
* Effective security controls for all API types, including cloud and Serverless API.

Please read this chapter in combination with all other chapters at this same level; we no longer duplicate authentication or API session management concerns.

## V13.1 Generic Web Service Security

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.1.1** | Verify that all application components use the same encodings and parsers to avoid parsing attacks that exploit different URI or file parsing behavior that could be used in SSRF and RFI attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |
| **13.1.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 4.3.1] | | | | |
| **13.1.3** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 8.3.1] | | | | |
| **13.1.4** | Verify that authorization decisions are made at both the URI, enforced by programmatic or declarative security at the controller or router, and at the resource level, enforced by model-based permissions. | | ✓ | ✓ | 285 |
| **13.1.5** | [DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT] | | | | |
| **13.1.6** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 13.2.6, LEVEL L2 > L3] Verify that per-message digital signatures are used to provide additional assurance on top of transport protections for requests/transactions which are highly sensitive or which traverse a number of systems. | | | ✓ | 345 |

## V13.2 RESTful Web Service

JSON schema validation is in a draft stage of standardization (see references). When considering using JSON schema validation, which is best practice for RESTful web services, consider using these additional data validation strategies in combination with JSON schema validation:

* Parsing validation of the JSON object, such as if there are missing or extra elements.
* Validation of the JSON object values using standard input validation methods, such as data type, data format, length, etc.
* and formal JSON schema validation.

Once the JSON schema validation standard is formalized, ASVS will update its advice in this area. Carefully monitor any JSON schema validation libraries in use, as they will need to be updated regularly until the standard is formalized and bugs are ironed out of reference implementations.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.2.1** | [MOVED TO 14.5.5] | | | | |
| **13.2.2** | Verify that JSON schema validation is in place and verified before accepting input. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **13.2.3** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 4.2.2] | | | | |
| **13.2.4** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 11.1.4] | | | | |
| **13.2.5** | Verify that REST services explicitly check the incoming Content-Type to be the expected one, such as application/xml or application/json. | | ✓ | ✓ | 436 |
| **13.2.6** | [MOVED TO 13.1.6] | | | | |

## V13.3 SOAP Web Service

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.3.1** | Verify that XSD schema validation takes place to ensure a properly formed XML document, followed by validation of each input field before any processing of that data takes place. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **13.3.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 13.2.6] | | | | |

Note: Due to issues with XXE attacks against DTDs, DTD validation should not be used, and framework DTD evaluation disabled as per the requirements set out in V14 Configuration.

## V13.4 GraphQL

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.4.1** | Verify that a query allow list or a combination of depth limiting and amount limiting is used to prevent GraphQL or data layer expression Denial of Service (DoS) as a result of expensive, nested queries. For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used. | | ✓ | ✓ | 770 |
| **13.4.2** | Verify that GraphQL or other data layer authorization logic should be implemented at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL layer. | | ✓ | ✓ | 285 |
| **13.4.3** | [ADDED] Verify that GraphQL introspection queries are disabled in production environment unless the GraphQL API is meant to be used by other parties. | | ✓ | ✓ | |

## V13.5 WebSocket

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.5.1** | [ADDED] Verify that WebSocket Secure (wss) is used for all WebSocket connections. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 319 |
| **13.5.2** | [ADDED] Verify that, during the initial HTTP WebSocket handshake, the Origin header is checked against an allow list of authorized origins. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 346 |
| **13.5.3** | [ADDED] Verify that rate limiting is in place for WebSocket messages. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 770 |
| **13.5.4** | [ADDED] Verify that tokens possess at least 128 bits of entropy and are generated using approved cryptographic algorithms if session or channel tokens specific to WebSockets are being used. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 331 |
| **13.5.5** | [ADDED] Verify that the tokens are initially obtained from a response to secure POST request only, and are not sent by the server through the WebSocket connection if session or channel tokens specific to WebSockets are being used. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 319 |
| **13.5.6** | [ADDED] Verify that authentication is done before opening the WebSocket connection if only authenticated users should be able to use WebSockets. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 306 |
