# V13 API and Web Service

## Control Objective

Ensure that an application that exposes APIs for use by a web browser or other consumers (commonly using JSON, XML or GraphQL) has the relevant security configurations and mechanisms applied.

Please read this chapter in combination with all other chapters at this same level; we do not duplicate authentication, session management, or general input validation concerns. Rather, the general requirements from those chapters always apply and therefore this chapter can not be taken out of context and be tested separately.

## V13.1 Generic Web Service Security

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.1.1** | [MOVED TO 5.5.5] | | | | |
| **13.1.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 4.3.1] | | | | |
| **13.1.3** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 8.3.1] | | | | |
| **13.1.4** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 4.2.1] | | | | |
| **13.1.5** | [DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT] | | | | |
| **13.1.6** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 13.2.6, LEVEL L2 > L3] Verify that per-message digital signatures are used to provide additional assurance on top of transport protections for requests or transactions which are highly sensitive or which traverse a number of systems. | | | ✓ | 345 |

## V13.2 RESTful Web Service

As at this time, there is a "published version" of the JSON schema validation specification, which is considered production ready. However, there is not yet a version which is considered strictly "stable". As such, when considering using JSON schema validation, be sure to also apply the standard input validation guidance from Chapter 5 of ASVS.

Due to the lack of a formal stable version of the JSON schema validation specification, carefully monitor any JSON schema validation libraries in use, as they may need to be updated once the standard is formalized and bugs are ironed out of reference implementations.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.2.1** | [MOVED TO 14.5.5] | | | | |
| **13.2.2** | [LEVEL L1 > L3] Verify that JSON schema validation is in place and verified before accepting input. | | | ✓ | 20 |
| **13.2.3** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 50.3.1] | | | | |
| **13.2.4** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 11.1.4] | | | | |
| **13.2.5** | Verify that REST services explicitly check the incoming Content-Type to be the expected one, such as application/xml or application/json. | | ✓ | ✓ | 436 |
| **13.2.6** | [MOVED TO 13.1.6] | | | | |

## V13.3 SOAP Web Service

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.3.1** | Verify that XSD schema validation takes place to ensure a properly formed XML document, followed by validation of each input field before any processing of that data takes place. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **13.3.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 13.2.6] | | | | |

Note: Due to issues with XXE attacks against DTDs, DTD validation should not be used, and framework DTD evaluation disabled as per the requirements set out in chapter V5.

## V13.4 GraphQL

GraphQL is becoming more common as a way of creating data rich clients which are not coupled to a varierty of different backend services. However, this mechanism also comes with some specific security considerations.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.4.1** | Verify that a query allow list or a combination of depth limiting and amount limiting is used to prevent GraphQL or data layer expression Denial of Service (DoS) as a result of expensive, nested queries. For more advanced scenarios, query cost analysis should be used. | | ✓ | ✓ | 770 |
| **13.4.2** | [MODIFIED] Verify that authorization logic is implemented at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL or resolver layer. | | ✓ | ✓ | 285 |
| **13.4.3** | [ADDED] Verify that GraphQL introspection queries are disabled in production environment unless the GraphQL API is meant to be used by other parties. | | ✓ | ✓ | |

## V13.5 WebSocket

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **13.5.1** | [ADDED] Verify that WebSocket over TLS (wss) is used for all WebSocket connections. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 319 |
| **13.5.2** | [ADDED] Verify that, during the initial HTTP WebSocket handshake, the Origin header is checked against a list of origins allowed for the application. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 346 |
| **13.5.3** | [ADDED] Verify that, if the application's standard session management cannot be used, dedicated tokens are being used for this which comply with the relevant Session Management security requirements. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 331 |
| **13.5.4** | [ADDED] Verify that dedicated WebSocket session management tokens are initially obtained or validated through the previously authenticated HTTPS session when transitioning an existing HTTPS session to a WebSocket channel. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 319 |
