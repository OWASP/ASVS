# V13 API and Web Service

## Control Objective

A number of considerations apply specifically for applications that exposes APIs for use by a web browser or other consumers (commonly using JSON, XML or GraphQL). This chapter covers relevant security configurations and mechanisms to be applied.

Please read this chapter in combination with all other chapters at this same level; we do not duplicate authentication, session management, or general input validation concerns. Rather, the general requirements from those chapters always apply and therefore this chapter can not be taken out of context and be tested separately.

## V1.13 API and Web Service Documentation

## V13.1 Generic Web Service Security

This section promotes generic web service security considerations and consequently basic web service hygiene practices in general.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.1.1** | [MOVED TO 5.5.5] | | |
| **13.1.2** | [DELETED] | | |
| **13.1.3** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 8.1.11] | | |
| **13.1.4** | [DELETED, COVERED BY 4.1.6] | | |
| **13.1.5** | [DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT] | | |
| **13.1.6** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 13.2.6, COVERS 13.3.2, LEVEL L2 > L3] Verify that per-message digital signatures are used to provide additional assurance on top of transport protections for requests or transactions which are highly sensitive or which traverse a number of systems. | 3 | 345 |
| **13.1.7** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 14.4.1, COVERS 5.3.2] Verify that every HTTP response with a message body contains a Content-Type header field that matches the actual content of the response, including the charset parameter to specify safe character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1) according to IANA Media Types, such as "text/", "/+xml" and "/xml". | 1 | 173 |
| **13.1.8** | [ADDED] Verify that only user-facing endpoints (intended for manual web-browser access) automatically redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, while other services or endpoints do not implement transparent redirects. This is to avoid a situation where a client is erroneously sending unencrypted HTTP requests but, since the requests are being automatically redirected to HTTPS, the leakage of sensitive data goes undiscovered. | 2 | |

## V13.2 Web Services

As at this time, there is a "published version" of the JSON schema validation specification, which is considered production ready. However, there is not yet a version which is considered strictly "stable". As such, when considering using JSON schema validation, be sure to also apply the standard input validation guidance from Chapter 5 of ASVS.

Due to the lack of a formal stable version of the JSON schema validation specification, carefully monitor any JSON schema validation libraries in use, as they may need to be updated once the standard is formalized and bugs are ironed out of reference implementations.

Note: Due to issues with XXE attacks against DTDs, DTD validation should not be used, and framework DTD evaluation disabled as per the requirements set out in chapter V5.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.2.1** | [MOVED TO 50.4.4] | | |
| **13.2.2** | [MODIFIED, MERGED FROM 13.3.1, LEVEL L1 > L3] Verify that structured data objects are validated to ensure they are properly formed, followed by validation of each input field before any processing of that data takes place. This could involve implementing schema validation for formats like JSON and XML. | 3 | 20 |
| **13.2.3** | [DELETED, COVERED BY 50.4.1, 50.4.3] | | |
| **13.2.4** | [DELETED] | | |
| **13.2.5** | [MOVED TO 50.4.3] | | |
| **13.2.6** | [MOVED TO 13.1.6] | | |

## V13.3 SOAP Web Service

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.3.1** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 13.2.2] | | |
| **13.3.2** | [DELETED, COVERED BY 13.1.6] | | |

## V13.4 GraphQL

GraphQL is becoming more common as a way of creating data rich clients which are not coupled to a variety of different backend services. This section covers security considerations for GraphQL.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.4.1** | [GRAMMAR] Verify that a query allowlist, depth limiting, amount limiting or query cost analysis is used to prevent GraphQL or data layer expression Denial of Service (DoS) as a result of expensive, nested queries. | 2 | 770 |
| **13.4.2** | [MODIFIED] Verify that authorization logic is implemented at the business logic layer instead of the GraphQL or resolver layer. | 2 | 285 |
| **13.4.3** | [ADDED] Verify that GraphQL introspection queries are disabled in the production environment unless the GraphQL API is meant to be used by other parties. | 2 | |

## V13.5 WebSocket

WebSocket is a communications protocol, providing a simultaneous two-way communication channel over a single TCP connection. It was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011 and is distinct from HTTP, even though it is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80.

This section provides key security requirements to prevent attacks related to communication security and session management that specifically exploit this real-time communication channel.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.5.1** | [ADDED] Verify that WebSocket over TLS (WSS) is used for all WebSocket connections. | 1 | 319 |
| **13.5.2** | [ADDED] Verify that, during the initial HTTP WebSocket handshake, the Origin header field is checked against a list of origins allowed for the application. | 1 | 346 |
| **13.5.3** | [ADDED] Verify that, if the application's standard session management cannot be used, dedicated tokens are being used for this which comply with the relevant Session Management security requirements. | 1 | 331 |
| **13.5.4** | [ADDED] Verify that dedicated WebSocket session management tokens are initially obtained or validated through the previously authenticated HTTPS session when transitioning an existing HTTPS session to a WebSocket channel. | 1 | 319 |

## V13.6 HTTP Request Header Validation

This section detatils HTTP request headers validations that can prevent attacks such as HTTP Request Smuggling or source spoofing.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.6.1** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 14.5.1] Verify that only HTTP methods that are explicitly supported by the application or its API (including OPTIONS during preflight requests) can be used and that unused methods are blocked. | 1 | 749 |
| **13.6.2** | [ADDED] Verify that all application components, including load balancers, firewalls, and application servers, comply with RFC 2616 by ignoring the Content-Length header field when a Transfer-Encoding header field is present, to prevent HTTP Request Smuggling. | 2 | 444 |
| **13.6.3** | [ADDED] Verify that any HTTP header field used by the application and defined by intermediary devices like load balancers or proxies, such as X-Real-IP and X-Forwarded-*, cannot be overridden by the end-user. | 2 | 346 |

## V13.7 HTTP/2

This section focuses on specific security considerations related to HTTP/2.

| # | Description | Level | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **13.7.1** | [ADDED] Verify that the value in the Content-Length request header field matches the calculated length using the built-in mechanism. | 1 | 400 |
| **13.7.2** | [ADDED] Verify that all Transfer-Encoding header fields are stripped from the message or that the request is blocked entirely. | 1 | |
| **13.7.3** | [ADDED] Verify that a full CRLF (\r\n) sequence is neutralized inside a HTTP/2 header. | 1 | 113 |
