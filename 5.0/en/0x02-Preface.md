# Preface

Welcome to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 5.0.

Established in 2008 through a collaborative community effort, the ASVS defines the security requirements to be considered when designing, developing, and testing modern web applications and web services.

The previous major version (4.0) was released in 2019 with the most recent minor version released in 2021 (4.0.3) so it is time for a new major version, updated and adapted with the latest developments in software security. 

ASVS version 5.0 is the culmination of significant effort from the leaders, the working group, and other community members to update and improve this important standard.

Version 5.0 has been developed with several key principles in mind.

The scope is defined more precisely to follow the words Application, Security, Verification, and Standard. The redefined scope and focus for requirements have changed the direction for wording to move towards preventing security problems instead of asking to implement a certain technical solution. Requirement texts also got attention to make them self-explanatory as to why the requirement exists.

Concept of documented security decisions as requirements is included in the ASVS to provide required information for implementing and verifying implementation requirements, and also to provide a flexibility mechanism for organizations, as each organization and application may have their own specific needs and risks to mitigate.

The philosophy for requirements levels in version 5.0 has changed, and levels are designed to make the ASVS easier to adopt. It still has three levels, starting from Level 1, which is built mainly for the requirements that are the first layer of defense, and to take the first step into ASVS. Level 2 can be considered as "standard security", and Level 3 as an "extra step forward".

ASVS v5.0 has resulted in around 350 requirements in 17 chapters. The attitude to use precise scoping and focus has also been used to restructure the ASVS. To help adoption from v4.0 to v5.0, all the changes are tracked and mapped through the years and are provided as two-way mapping files.

As the security is never done and ready, neither is ASVS. The major release allows the wider community to benefit from the improvements and additions accumulated over several years and take them all into use. At the same time, it does not mean the ASVS is done and finished, the development continues.

The defined scope for ASVS sets a "requirements only" direction and leaves everything else to be built on top of that fundamental base. That includes supplemental guidance around implementation and testing, and this release should provide the impetus for setting up working groups to progress those areas.
