# Appendix W: LLM Security

## Introduction

The popularity of Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT variants from OpenAI has been on a rise, giving applications the power to generate human-like text based on prompts. However, this has opened up many potential vulnerabilities.

Whilst this topic is not the core competency of the ASVS, we wanted to include some basic guidelines as an appendix in the hope that a more comprehensive Verification Standard will be prepared for LLMs and AI in general in the future.
