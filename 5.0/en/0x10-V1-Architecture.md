# V1 Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling

## Control Objective

Security architecture has almost become a lost art in many organizations. The days of the enterprise architect have passed in the age of DevSecOps. The application security field must catch up and adopt agile security principles while re-introducing leading security architecture principles to software practitioners. Architecture is not an implementation, but a way of thinking about a problem that has potentially many different answers, and no one single "correct" answer. All too often, security is seen as inflexible and demanding that developers fix code in a particular way, when the developers may know a much better way to solve the problem. There is no single, simple solution for architecture, and to pretend otherwise is a disservice to the software engineering field.

A specific implementation of a web application is likely to be revised continuously throughout its lifetime, but the overall architecture will likely rarely change but evolve slowly. Security architecture is identical - we need authentication today, we will require authentication tomorrow, and we will need it five years from now. If we make sound decisions today, we can save a lot of effort, time, and money if we select and re-use architecturally compliant solutions. For example, a decade ago, multi-factor authentication was rarely implemented.

If developers had invested in a single, secure identity provider model, such as SAML federated identity, the identity provider could be updated to incorporate new requirements such as NIST SP 800-63 compliance, while not changing the interfaces of the original application. If many applications share the same security architecture and thus that same component, they all benefit from this upgrade at once. However, SAML will not always remain as the best or most suitable authentication solution - it might need to be swapped out for other solutions as requirements change. Changes like this are either complicated, so costly as to necessitate a complete re-write, or outright impossible without security architecture.

In this chapter, the ASVS covers the primary aspects of any sound security architecture: availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, non-repudiation, and privacy. Each of these security principles must be built in and be innate to all applications. It is critical to "shift left", starting with developer enablement with secure coding checklists, mentoring and training, coding and testing, building, deployment, configuration, and operations, and finishing with follow up independent testing to assure that all of the security controls are present and functional. The last step used to be everything we did as an industry, but that is no longer sufficient when developers push code into production tens or hundreds of times a day. Application security professionals must keep up with agile techniques, which means adopting developer tools, learning to code, and working with developers rather than criticizing the project months after everyone else has moved on.

## V1.2 Authentication Architecture

When designing authentication, it doesn't matter if you have strong hardware enabled multi-factor authentication if an attacker can reset an account by calling a call center and answering commonly known questions. When proving identity, all authentication pathways must have the same strength.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1.2.1** | [MOVED TO 1.14.7] | | | | |

| **1.2.3** | Verify that the application uses a single vetted authentication mechanism that is known to be secure, can be extended to include strong authentication, and has sufficient logging and monitoring to detect account abuse or breaches. | | ✓ | ✓ | 306 |
| **1.2.4** | [MODIFIED, SPLIT TO 2.2.11] Verify that, if the application includes multiple authentication pathways, these are all documented together with the security controls and authentication strength which should be consistently enforced across them. | | ✓ | ✓ | 306 |
| **1.2.5** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 2.5.4] Verify that default user accounts (e.g. "root", "admin", or "sa") are not present in the application or are disabled. | | ✓ | ✓ | 798 |

## V1.4 Access Control Architecture

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1.4.1** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 4.1.1] | | | | |

| **1.4.5** | Verify that attribute or feature-based access control is used whereby the code checks the user's authorization for a feature/data item rather than just their role. Permissions should still be allocated using roles. ([C7](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | | ✓ | ✓ | 275 |
| **1.4.6** | [ADDED] Verify that communications between application components, including APIs, middleware and data layers, are performed with the least necessary privileges. ([C3](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | | ✓ | ✓ | 272 |

## V1.5 Input and Output Architecture

In 4.0, we moved away from the term "server-side" as a loaded trust boundary term. The trust boundary is still concerning - making decisions on untrusted browsers or client devices is bypassable. However, in mainstream architectural deployments today, the trust enforcement point has dramatically changed. Therefore, where the term "trusted service layer" is used in the ASVS, we mean any trusted enforcement point, regardless of location, such as a microservice, serverless API, server-side, a trusted API on a client device that has secure boot, partner or external APIs, and so on.

The "untrusted client" term here refers to client-side technologies that render the presentation layer, commonly referred to as 'front-end' technologies. The term "serialization" here not only refers to sending data over the wire like an array of values or taking and reading a JSON structure, but also passing complex objects which can contain logic.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| **1.5.3** | [MOVED TO 5.1.6] | | | | |
| **1.5.4** | [MOVED TO 5.3.11] | | | | |

## V1.6 Cryptographic Architecture

Applications need to be designed with strong cryptographic architecture to protect data assets as per their classification. Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.

Architectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integration test. Architectural requirements require consideration in coding standards, throughout the coding phase, and should be reviewed during security architecture, peer or code reviews, or retrospectives.

| **1.6.4** | [GRAMMAR] Verify that the architecture treats client-side secrets - such as symmetric keys, passwords, or API tokens - as insecure and never uses them to protect or access sensitive data. | | ✓ | ✓ | 320 |
