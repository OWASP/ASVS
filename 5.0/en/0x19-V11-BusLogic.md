# V11 Business Logic

## Control Objective

Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high-level requirements:

* The business logic flow is sequential, processed in order, and cannot be bypassed.
* Business logic includes limits and controls to detect and prevent automated attacks, such as continuous small funds transfers and adding a million friends one at a time.
* High-value business logic flows have considered abuse cases and malicious actors, and have protections against spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, and elevation of privilege attacks.

## V1.11 Business Logic Documentation

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1.11.1** | [DELETED, NOT IN SCOPE] | | | | |
| **1.11.2** | [MOVED TO 10.7.2] | | | | |
| **1.11.3** | [MOVED TO 10.7.1] | | | | |
| **1.11.4** | [ADDED] Verify that expectations for business logic limits and validations are clearly documented including both per-user and also globally across the application. | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **1.11.5** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 1.5.1, LEVEL L2 > L1] Verify that input validation rules define how to check the validity of data items against an expected structure. This could be common data formats such as credit card numbers, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, or it could be an internal data format. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **1.11.6** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 1.5.1, LEVEL L2 > L1] Verify that input validation rules are documented and define how to ensure the logical and contextual consistency of combined data items, such as checking that suburb and zip code match. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |

## V11.1 Business Logic Security

Business logic security is so individual to every application that no one checklist will ever apply. Business logic security must be designed into the system to protect against likely external threats - it cannot be added using web application firewalls or secure communications.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **11.1.1** | Verify that the application will only process business logic flows for the same user in sequential step order and without skipping steps. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 841 |
| **11.1.2** | [MOVED TO 11.2.1] | | | | |
| **11.1.3** | [MODIFIED, MERGED FROM 11.1.5] Verify that business logic limits and validations are implemented as per the application's documentation, to avoid business logic flaws being exploited such as buying items for a negative amount. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **11.1.4** | [MOVED TO 11.2.2] | | | | |
| **11.1.5** | [DELETED, MERGED TO 11.1.3] | | | | |
| **11.1.6** | [MOVED TO 10.7.3] | | | | |
| **11.1.7** | [MOVED TO 7.2.4] | | | | |
| **11.1.8** | [MOVED TO 7.2.5] | | | | |
| **11.1.9** | [ADDED] Verify that "atomic transactions" are being used at the business logic level such that either a business logic operation succeeds in its entirety, or it is rolled back to the previous correct state. | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **11.1.10** | [ADDED] Verify that very high-value business logic flows are restricted with multi-user approval to prevent unauthorized or accidental actions. This could include but is not limited to large monetary transfers, contract approvals, access to critical nuclear facility operations, healthcare record modifications, access to classified information, or safety overrides in manufacturing. | | | ✓ | |

## V11.2 Anti-automation

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **11.2.1** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 11.1.2, LEVEL L1 > L3] Verify that business logic processes require realistic human timing, preventing excessively rapid transaction submissions. | | | ✓ | 799 |
| **11.2.2** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 11.1.4, LEVEL L1 > L2] Verify that anti-automation controls are in place to protect against excessive calls to application functions that could lead to data exfiltration, garbage data creation, quota exhaustion, rate limit breaches, denial of service, or overuse of costly resources. | | ✓ | ✓ | 770 |

## 11.3 Input Validation

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **11.3.1** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 5.1.3] Verify that input which is used to make business or security decisions is validated using positive validation, against an allowed list of values, patterns or ranges to enforce business or functional expectations for that input. For L2, input validation should be implemented globally. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **11.3.2** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 5.1.4] Verify that data items with an expected structure, and which are used to make business or security decisions, are validated according to the pre-defined rules. For L2, input validation must be implemented globally. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **11.3.3** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 5.1.4, LEVEL L1 > L2] Verify that the application ensures that combinations of related data items are reasonable according to the pre-defined rules. | | ✓ | ✓ | 20 |
| **11.3.4** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 1.5.3, LEVEL L2 > L1] Verify that the application is designed to enforce input validation at a trusted service layer. While client-side validation improves usability, it must not be relied upon as a security control. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 602 |
