| IDEA |
| RC4 |

### AES Cipher Modes

Modern ciphers make use of various modes, particularly AES for various purposes. We describe the requirements on AES Cipher Modes here.

#### Approved Cipher Modes for General Use Cases

The following modes are approved except where the function is encrypted data storage (see next subsection):

| AES Encryption Mode | Authenticated | Reference | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| GCM | Yes | [NIST SP 800-38D](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/d/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| CCM | Yes | [NIST SP 800-38C](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/c/upd1/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| CCM-8 | Yes | [RFC 6655](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6655) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| CBC* | No | [NIST SP 800-38A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/a/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

\* All encrypted messages must be authenticated. Given this, for ANY use of CBC mode there MUST be an associated hashing function or MAC to validate the message. In general, this MUST be applied in the Encrypt-Then-Hash method (but TLS 1.2 uses Hash-Then-Encrypt instead). If this cannot be guaranteed, then CBC MUST NOT be used.

#### Recommendations for Approved Cipher Modes for General Use Cases

Out of the given approved block modes, implementations SHOULD use the ciphers in this list, in order of preference:

| AES Encryption Mode | Reference | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| GCM | [NIST SP 800-38D](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/d/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| CCM | [NIST SP 800-38C](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/c/upd1/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

#### Approved Cipher Modes ONLY for Data Storage (block encryption on disk)

The following disk-level block encryption modes are approved and are listed in order of preference:

| AES Disk Encryption Mode | Reference | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| XTS | [NIST SP 800-38E](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/e/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| XEX | [Rogaway 2004](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30539-2_2) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| LRW | [Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner 2005](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00145-010-9073-y) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

#### Disallowed Cipher Modes

The following cipher modes MUST NOT be used for any use case:

| Encryption Mode |
|--|
| ECB |
| CFB |
| OFB |
| CTR |

### Key Wrapping

Cryptographic key wrap (and corresponding key unwrap) is a method of protecting an existing key by encapsulating (i.e. wrapping) it by employing an additional encryption mechanism so that the original key is not obviously exposed, e.g. during a transfer. This additional key used to protect the original key is referred to as the wrap key.

This operation may be performed when it is desirable to protect keys in places deemed untrustworthy, or to send sensitive keys over untrusted networks or within applications.
However, serious consideration should be given to understanding the nature (e.g. the identity and the purpose) of the original key prior to committing to a wrap/unwrap procedure as this may have repercussions for both source and target systems/applications in terms of security and especially compliance which may include audit trails of a key's function (e.g. signing) as well as appropriate key storage.

ONLY AES-256 MUST be used for key wrapping, following [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) and considering forward-looking provisions against the quantum threat. Cipher modes using AES are the following, in order of preference:

| Key Wrapping | Reference | L1 | L2 | L3 |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| KW | [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| KWP | [NIST SP 800-38F](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/f/final) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

AES-192 and AES-128 MAY be used if the use case demands it, but its motivation MUST be documented in the entity's cryptography inventory.

## Hashing and Hash-based Functions (V6.6)

### Approved Hash Functions for General Use Cases

The following hash functions are approved for use in general cryptographic use cases such as digital signatures, HMAC, key derivation functions (KDF), and random bit generation (RBG). These functions provide strong collision resistance and are suitable for high-security applications. Some of these algorithms offer strong resistance to attacks when used with proper cryptographic key management, and so are additionally approved for HMAC, KDF, and RBG functions.

IKEv2 groups are provided for reference ([NIST SP 800-77](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/77/r1/final)). Equivalent groups might be used in other protocols. This list is ordered STRONGEST to WEAKEST. Security strengths are documented in [NIST SP 800-56A](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/56/a/r3/final), Appendix D, and [NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Rev.5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt1/r5/final).

Specifically, IKEv1 MUST NOT be used in production.

## Message Authentication Codes (MAC)

Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are cryptographic constructs used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. A MAC takes a message and a secret key as inputs and produces a fixed-size tag (the MAC value). MACs are widely used in secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL) to ensure that messages exchanged between parties are authentic and intact.

### Approved MAC Algorithms

The following MAC algorithms are approved for use in securing messages by providing integrity and authenticity guarantees. Implementations MUST use only authenticated encryption modes or separately applied HMAC to ensure the security of messages:

### Disallowed KDFs

The following KDFs are explicitly banned and MUST NOT be used due to insufficient security properties or known weaknesses:

| KDF            | Reference                                                                          |

### Post-Quantum Encryption Standards

PQC implementations must be in line with [FIPS-203](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd)/[204](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/ipd)/[205](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/ipd) as there isn't any hardened code nor implementation reference yet. https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards
