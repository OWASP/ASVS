# V4 Access Control

## Control Objective

Authorization is the concept of allowing access to resources only to those permitted to use them. Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high level requirements:

* Persons accessing resources hold valid credentials to do so.
* Users are associated with a well-defined set of entitlements.
* Access control policy metadata is protected from replay or tampering.

## V4.1 General Access Control Design

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **4.1.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that the application enforces access control rules at a trusted service layer and doesn't rely on controls which an untrusted user could manipulate such as client-side JavaScript. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 602 |
| **4.1.2** | [DELETED, INCORRECT] | | | | |
| **4.1.3** | Verify that the principle of least privilege exists - users should only be able to access functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other resources, for which they possess specific authorization. This implies protection against spoofing and elevation of privilege. ([C7](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 285 |
| **4.1.4** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 4.1.3] | | | | |
| **4.1.5** | [GRAMMAR] Verify that access controls fail securely by denying access, including when an exception occurs. ([C10](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 285 |

## V4.2 Operation Level Access Control

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **4.2.1** | Verify that sensitive data and APIs are protected against Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) attacks targeting creation, reading, updating and deletion of records, such as creating or updating someone else's record, viewing everyone's records, or deleting all records. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 639 |
| **4.2.2** | [MODIFIED, MERGED FROM 13.2.3] Verify that the application defends against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks to protect authenticated or sensitive public functionality using the development framework's built-in anti-CSRF functionality or CSRF tokens plus additional defense in depth measures. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 352 |
| **4.2.3** | [ADDED] Verify that messages received by the postMessage interface are discarded if the origin of the message is not trusted, or if the syntax of the message is invalid. | | ✓ | ✓ | 346 |

## V4.3 Other Access Control Considerations

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **4.3.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify administrative interfaces can only be logically accessed from trusted endpoints or locations. For example, restricting access to bastion or jump hosts, trusted admin workstations or endpoints (e.g., device authentication), administrative LANs, etc. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 419 |
| **4.3.2** | [SPLIT TO 14.3.4, 14.3.5] | | | | |
| **4.3.3** | Verify the application has additional authorization (such as step up or adaptive authentication) for lower value systems, and / or segregation of duties for high value applications to enforce anti-fraud controls as per the risk of application and past fraud. | | ✓ | ✓ | 732 |
