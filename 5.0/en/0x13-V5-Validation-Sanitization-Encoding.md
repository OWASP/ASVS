# V5 Validation, Sanitization and Encoding

## Control Objective

The most common web application security weakness is using untrusted content in an unsafe context without any output encoding, query parameterization, or other output handling defense. This weakness leads to almost all of the significant vulnerabilities in web applications, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, OS command injection, template injection, log injection, LDAP injection, and more.

Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high-level requirements:

* Input validation and output encoding architecture have an agreed pipeline to prevent injection attacks.
* Input data is strongly typed, validated, range or length checked, or at worst, sanitized or filtered.
* Output data is encoded or escaped as per the context of the data as close to the interpreter as possible.

With modern web application architecture, output encoding is more important than ever. It is difficult to provide robust input validation in certain scenarios, so the use of safer API such as parameterized queries, auto-escaping templating frameworks, or carefully chosen output encoding is critical to the security of the application.

## V5.1 Input Validation

Input can come from a variety of sources including HTML form fields, REST requests, URL parameters, HTTP headers, cookies, files on disk, databases, external APIs, etc.

Properly implemented input validation controls, using positive allow lists and strong data typing, provide an important enforcement of business logic controls around the type of data that the app expects to receive. However, except in specific cases, it is generally not intended to prevent specific attacks.

Input validation still provides valuable security hygiene and should be applied to all inputs where possible. However, since input validation is not a complete security strategy, one should also make use of sandboxing, sanitization, encoding and parameterization whenever the input is being used in a potentially dangerous context.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

| **5.1.6** | [ADDED] Verify that untrusted input is validated for length before being included in a cookie (including as part of a JWT) and that the cookie name and value length combined are not over 4096 bytes. | | ✓ | ✓ | |

## V5.2 Sanitization and Sandboxing

Input validation is a complicated topic.

Sometimes input validation is not going to be helpful for security, other times it will help it to a moderate degree, whilst other times it will be fundamental for security defense. It depends on the type of data and the use of that data to determine how effective input validation will be.

For example:

* Sanitization: When a user is authoring HTML, the standard defense is to standardize HTML to remove Performing JSON sanitizing before JSON parsers are used, and of course HTML sanitization for XSS defense
* Escaping: Done in the UI when you want to preserve displaying content as the user typed it in, also for some injection protection like LDAP injection protection
* Parameterization: For SQL Injection, primarily
* Sandboxing: When you can't sanitize HTML for some reason and need to dump potentially active content on your web page, iFrame sandboxing is critical. CSP has some sandboxing capabilities, too.
* URLs in Web UIs should block JavaScript and data URLs as a defense against XSS attacks. However, it's important to note that often, even valid data can still pose a threat.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.2.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that all untrusted HTML input from WYSIWYG editors or similar is properly sanitized using a well-known and secure HTML sanitization library or framework feature. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |

## V5.3 Output Encoding and Injection Prevention

Output encoding close or adjacent to the interpreter in use is critical to the security of any application. Typically, output encoding is not persisted, but rather used to render output safely in the appropriate context for immediate use. Failing to output encode will result in an insecure, injectable, and unsafe application.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.3.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that output encoding for an HTTP response/HTML document/XML document is relevant for the context required, such as encoding the relevant characters for HTML elements, HTML attributes, HTML comments, JavaScript, CSS, or HTTP headers, to avoid changing the message or document structure. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |
| **5.3.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 14.4.1] | | | | |
| **5.3.3** | Verify that context-aware, preferably automated - or at worst, manual - output escaping protects against reflected, stored, and DOM based XSS. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 79 |
| **5.3.4** | [MODIFIED] Verify that data selection or database queries (e.g. SQL, HQL, NoSQL, Cypher) use parameterized queries, ORMs, entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from SQL Injection and other database injection attacks. This should also be considered when writing stored procedures. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 89 |
| **5.3.5** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 5.3.4] | | | | |
| **5.3.6** | [MODIFIED] Verify that the application protects against JSON injection attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 75 |
| **5.3.7** | Verify that the application protects against LDAP injection vulnerabilities, or that specific security controls to prevent LDAP injection have been implemented. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 90 |
| **5.3.8** | Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 78 |
| **5.3.9** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 12.3.2, 12.3.3] | | | | |
| **5.3.10** | Verify that the application protects against XPath injection or XML injection attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 643 |
| **5.3.11** | [ADDED] Verify that the application is protected against CSV and Formula Injection. The application should follow the escaping rules defined in RFC4180 2.6 and 2.7 when exporting CSV files. The application should escape special characters including '=', '+', '-', '@' '\t' (tab) and '\00' (null character) using a single quote, if they are the first character in a field, when exporting CSV files and other spreadsheet formats such as xls, xlsx, odf. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 1236 |
| **5.3.12** | [ADDED] Verify that LaTeX processors are configured securely (such as not using the "--shell-escape" flag) and command allow-listing is used to prevent LaTeX injection attacks. | | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **5.3.13** | [ADDED, SPLIT FROM 5.3.1] Verify that when dynamically building URLs, untrusted data is encoded according to its context (e.g., URL encoding or base64url encoding for query or path parameters). Ensure that only safe URL protocols are permitted (e.g., disallow javascript: or data:). | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |
| **5.3.14** | [ADDED] Verify that output encoding is relevant for the interpreter and context required in any context where a potentially dangerous interpreter, not mentioned above, is being used. | | ✓ | ✓ | |

Note: Using parameterized queries or escaping SQL is not always sufficient; table and column names, ORDER BY and so on, cannot be escaped. The inclusion of escaped user-supplied data in these fields results in failed queries or SQL injection.

Note: The SVG format explicitly allows ECMA script in almost all contexts, so it may not be possible to block all SVG XSS vectors completely. If SVG upload is required, we strongly recommend either serving these uploaded files as text/plain or using a separate user-supplied content domain to prevent successful XSS from taking over the application.

## V5.4 Memory, String, and Unmanaged Code

The following requirements will only apply when the application uses a systems language or unmanaged code.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.4.1** | Verify that the application uses memory-safe string, safer memory copy and pointer arithmetic to detect or prevent stack, buffer, or heap overflows. | | ✓ | ✓ | 120 |
| **5.4.2** | [DELETED, MOVED TO 5.2.13] | | | | |
| **5.4.3** | Verify that sign, range, and input validation techniques are used to prevent integer overflows. | | ✓ | ✓ | 190 |

## V5.5 Deserialization Prevention

| **5.5.1** | [DELETED, INCORRECT] | | | | |
| **5.5.2** | Verify that the application correctly restricts XML parsers to only use the most restrictive configuration possible and to ensure that unsafe features such as resolving external entities are disabled to prevent XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 611 |
| **5.5.3** | [MODIFIED, MERGED FROM 1.5.2] Verify that if deserialization is used when communicating with untrusted clients, the input is handled safely. For example, by only allowing a allow-list of object types or not allowing the client to define the object type to deserialize to, in order to prevent deserialization attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 502 |
| **5.5.4** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 5.2.4] | | | | |
| **5.5.5** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 13.1.1, LEVEL L1 > L2] Verify that different parsers used in the application for the same data type (e.g. JSON parsers, XML parsers, URL parsers), perform parsing in a consistent way and use the same character encoding mechanism to avoid issues such as JSON Interoperability vulnerabilities or different URI or file parsing behavior being exploited in Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. | | ✓ | ✓ | 436 |

## V5.6 Validation and Sanitization Architecture

With syntax-specific requirements we say "do the correct thing" and here are the requirements to say "do it in the correct order" and "do it in the correct place".

Also, the requirements aim to ensure that whenever data is being stored, it is stored in its original state and not in an encoded state (e.g. HTML encoding) to prevent double encoding issues.

<!--
The requirement belongs here if it is:

  * input validation, sanitization or encoding architecture
  * input validation, sanitization or encoding processing (order)

The requirement does not belong here, if it is:

  * syntax specific or clear input validation, sanitization or encoding requirement

reorg: move it to 1st chapter in the paragraph

| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.6.1** | [ADDED] Verify that input is decoded or unescaped into a canonical form only once and that this is done before processing the input further, for example it is not performed after input validation or sanitization. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 174 |
| **5.6.2** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 1.5.3, LEVEL L2 > L1] Verify that the application is designed to enforce input validation at a trusted service layer. While client-side validation improves usability, security must not rely on it. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 602 |
| **5.6.3** | [MODIFIED, MOVED FROM 1.5.4] Verify that the application performs output encoding and escaping either as a final step before being used by the interpreter for which it is intended or by the interpreter itself. | | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |
