# V5 Validation, Sanitization and Encoding

## Control Objective

The most common web application security weakness is the failure to properly validate input coming from the client or the environment before directly using it without any output encoding. This weakness leads to almost all of the significant vulnerabilities in web applications, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, interpreter injection, locale/Unicode attacks, file system attacks, and buffer overflows.

Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high-level requirements:

* Input validation and output encoding architecture have an agreed pipeline to prevent injection attacks.
* Input data is strongly typed, validated, range or length checked, or at worst, sanitized or filtered.
* Output data is encoded or escaped as per the context of the data as close to the interpreter as possible.

With modern web application architecture, output encoding is more important than ever. It is difficult to provide robust input validation in certain scenarios, so the use of safer API such as parameterized queries, auto-escaping templating frameworks, or carefully chosen output encoding is critical to the security of the application.

## V5.1 Input Validation

Properly implemented input validation controls, using positive allow lists and strong data typing, can sometimes eliminate injection attacks. However, sometimes input validation is not going to be effective in security, for example a valid e-mail address/URL can still be used to conduct successful attacks.

Input validation is still important security hygiene and should be applied to all inputs where possible.

Sometimes input validation is not going to be helpful for security, other times it will help it to a moderate degree, whilst other times it will be fundamental for security defense. It depends on the type of data and the use of that data to determine how effective input validation will be. Because input validation is not a complete security strategy, one should also make use of sandboxing, santisation, encoding and parameterisation.

## V5.2 Sanitization and Sandboxing

Input validation is a complicated topic.

Sometimes input validation is not going to be helpful for security, other times it will help it to a moderate degree, whilst other times it will be fundamental for security defense. It depends on the type of data and the use of that data to determine how effective input validation will be.

For example:

* Santization: When a user is authoring HTML, the standard defense is to standardise HTML to remove Performing JSON sanitizing before JSON parsers are used, and of course HTML sanitization for XSS defense
* Escaping: Done in the UI when you want to preserve displaying content as the user typed it in, also for some injection protection like LDAP injection protection
* Parameterization: For SQL Injection, primarily
* Sandboxing: When you can't sanitize HTML for some reason and need to dump potentially active content on your web page, iFrame sandboxing is critical. CSP has some sandboxing capabilities, too.
* Really important for URL's in Web UI's to stop JavaScript and data URL's (XSS defense) - but often valid data is still dangerous

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.2.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that all untrusted HTML input from WYSIWYG editors or similar is properly sanitized using a well-known and secure HTML sanitization library or framework feature. ([C5](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |

| **5.2.8** | Verify that the application sanitizes, disables, or sandboxes user-supplied scriptable or expression template language content, such as Markdown, CSS or XSL stylesheets, BBCode, or similar. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 94 |

## V5.3 Output Encoding and Injection Prevention

Output encoding close or adjacent to the interpreter in use is critical to the security of any application. Typically, output encoding is not persisted, but used to render the output safe in the appropriate output context for immediate use. Failing to output encode will result in an insecure, injectable, and unsafe application.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.3.1** | [MODIFIED] Verify that output encoding is relevant for the interpreter and context required. For example, use encoders specifically for HTML values, HTML attributes, JavaScript, CSS, URL parameters, HTTP headers, SMTP, and others as the context requires, especially from untrusted inputs (e.g. names with Unicode or apostrophes, such as ねこ or O'Hara). ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |
| **5.3.2** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 14.4.1] | | | | |
| **5.3.3** | Verify that context-aware, preferably automated - or at worst, manual - output escaping protects against reflected, stored, and DOM based XSS. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 79 |
| **5.3.4** | Verify that data selection or database queries (e.g. SQL, HQL, ORM, NoSQL) use parameterized queries, ORMs, entity frameworks, or are otherwise protected from database injection attacks. ([C3](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 89 |
| **5.3.5** | [DELETED, DUPLICATE OF 5.3.4] | | | | |
| **5.3.6** | [MODIFIED] Verify that the application protects against JSON injection attacks. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 75 |
| **5.3.7** | Verify that the application protects against LDAP injection vulnerabilities, or that specific security controls to prevent LDAP injection have been implemented. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 90 |
| **5.3.8** | Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 78 |
| **5.3.9** | Verify that the application protects against Local File Inclusion (LFI) or Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 829 |
| **5.3.10** | Verify that the application protects against XPath injection or XML injection attacks. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 643 |
| **5.3.11** | [MOVED FROM 1.5.4] Verify that output encoding occurs close to or by the interpreter for which it is intended. ([C4](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering)) | | ✓ | ✓ | 116 |

Note: Using parameterized queries or escaping SQL is not always sufficient; table and column names, ORDER BY and so on, cannot be escaped. The inclusion of escaped user-supplied data in these fields results in failed queries or SQL injection.

Note: The SVG format explicitly allows ECMA script in almost all contexts, so it may not be possible to block all SVG XSS vectors completely. If SVG upload is required, we strongly recommend either serving these uploaded files as text/plain or using a separate user supplied content domain to prevent successful XSS from taking over the application.

## V5.4 Memory, String, and Unmanaged Code

The following requirements will only apply when the application uses a systems language or unmanaged code.

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **5.4.1** | Verify that the application uses memory-safe string, safer memory copy and pointer arithmetic to detect or prevent stack, buffer, or heap overflows. | | ✓ | ✓ | 120 |
| **5.4.2** | Verify that format strings do not take potentially hostile input, and are constant. | | ✓ | ✓ | 134 |
| **5.4.3** | Verify that sign, range, and input validation techniques are used to prevent integer overflows. | | ✓ | ✓ | 190 |

## V5.5 Deserialization Prevention

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 | CWE |

| **5.5.1** | [DELETED, INCORRECT] | | | | |
| **5.5.2** | Verify that the application correctly restricts XML parsers to only use the most restrictive configuration possible and to ensure that unsafe features such as resolving external entities are disabled to prevent XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 611 |
| **5.5.3** | [MODIFIED, MERGED FROM 1.5.2] Verify that deserialization is not used when communicating with untrusted clients. If this is not possible, ensure that deserialization is performed safely, for example, by only allowing a allow-list of object types or not allowing the client to define the object type to deserialize to, in order to prevent deserialization attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 502 |
| **5.5.4** | Verify that when parsing JSON in browsers or JavaScript-based backends, JSON.parse is used to parse the JSON document. Do not use eval() to parse JSON. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 95 |
