# Appendix C: Internet of Things Verification Requirements

This chapter was originally in the main branch, but with the work that the OWASP IoT team has done, it doesn't make sense to maintain two different threads on the subject. For the 4.0 release, we are moving this to the Appendix, and urge all who require this, to rather use the main [OWASP IoT project](https://owasp.org/www-project-internet-of-things/)

## Control Objective

Embedded/IoT devices should:

* Have the same level of security controls within the device as found in the server, by enforcing security controls in a trusted environment.
* Sensitive data stored on the device should be done so in a secure manner using hardware backed storage such as secure elements.
* All sensitive data transmitted from the device should utilize transport layer security.
