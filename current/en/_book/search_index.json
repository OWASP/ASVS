The ASVS is a community-driven effort to establish a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on defining the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing and testing modern web applications and web services.\nVersion 4.0.2 was the second minor patch to v4.0 intended to fix spelling errors and make requirements clearer without making breaking changes such as materially changing requirements or adding/removing requirements.\nThis version is a \"Bleeding Edge\" version which is constantly being updated and should not be used for testing against a standard.\nASVS v4.0 is the culmination of community effort and industry feedback over the last decade. We have attempted to make it easier to adopt the ASVS for a variety of different use cases throughout any secure software development lifecycle.\nWe expect that there will most likely never be 100% agreement on the contents of any web application standard, including the ASVS. Risk analysis is always subjective to some extent, which creates a challenge when attempting to generalize in a one-size-fits-all standard. However, we hope that the latest updates made in this version are a step in the right direction, and enhance the concepts introduced in this critical industry standard.\nWhat's new in 4.0\nThe most significant change in this version is the adoption of the NIST 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines, introducing modern, evidence based, and advanced authentication controls. Although we expect  some pushback on aligning with an advanced authentication standard, we feel that it is essential for standards to be aligned, mainly when another well-regarded application security standard is evidence-based.\nInformation security standards should try to minimize the number of unique requirements, so that complying organizations do not have to decide on competing or incompatible controls. The OWASP Top 10 2017 and now the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard have now aligned with NIST 800-63 for authentication and session management. We encourage other standards-setting bodies to work with us, NIST, and others to come to a generally accepted set of application security controls to maximize security and minimize compliance costs.\nASVS 4.0 has been wholly renumbered from start to finish. The new numbering scheme allowed us to close up gaps from long-vanished chapters, and to allow us to segment longer chapters to minimize the number of controls that a developer or team have to comply. For example, if an application does not use JWT, the entire section on JWT in session management is not applicable.\nNew in 4.0 is a comprehensive mapping to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), one of the most commonly desired feature requests we've had over the last decade. CWE mapping allows tool manufacturers and those using vulnerability management software to match up results from other tools and previous ASVS versions to 4.0 and later. To make room for the CWE entry, we've had to retire the \"Since\" column, which as we completely renumbered, makes less sense than in previous versions of the ASVS. Not every item in the ASVS has an associated CWE, and as CWE has a great deal of duplication, we've attempted to use the most commonly used rather than necessarily the closest match. Verification controls are not always mappable to equivalent weaknesses. We welcome ongoing discussion with the CWE community and information security field more generally on closing this gap.\nWe have worked to comprehensively meet and exceed the requirements for addressing the OWASP Top 10 2017 and the OWASP Proactive Controls 2018. As the OWASP Top 10 2017 is the bare minimum to avoid negligence, we have deliberately made all but specific logging Top 10 requirements Level 1 controls, making it easier for OWASP Top 10 adopters to step up to an actual security standard.\nWe set out to ensure that the ASVS 4.0 Level 1 is a comprehensive superset of PCI DSS 3.2.1 Sections 6.5, for application design, coding, testing, secure code reviews, and penetration tests. This necessitated covering buffer overflow and unsafe memory operations in V5, and unsafe memory-related compilation flags in V14, in addition to existing industry-leading application and web service verification requirements.\nWe have completed the shift of the ASVS from monolithic server-side only controls, to providing security controls for all modern applications and APIs. In the days of functional programming, server-less API, mobile, cloud, containers, CI/CD and DevSecOps, federation and more, we cannot continue to ignore modern application architecture. Modern applications are designed very differently to those built when the original ASVS was released in 2009. The ASVS must always look far into the future so that we provide sound advice for our primary audience - developers. We have clarified or dropped any requirement that assumes that applications are executed on systems owned by a single organization.\nDue to the size of the ASVS 4.0, as well as our desire to become the baseline ASVS for all other ASVS efforts, we have retired the mobile chapter, in favor of the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). The Internet of Things appendix will appear in a future IoT ASVS care of the OWASP Internet of Things Project. We have included an early preview of the IoT ASVS in Appendix C. We thank both the OWASP Mobile Team and OWASP IoT Project Team for their support of the ASVS, and look forward to working with them in the future to provide complementary standards.\nLastly, we have de-duped and retired less impactful controls. Over time, the ASVS started being a comprehensive set of controls, but not all controls are equal at producing secure software. This effort to eliminate low impact items could go further. In a future edition of the ASVS, the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS) will help prioritize further those controls which are truly important and those that should be retired.\nAs of version 4.0, the ASVS will focus solely on being the leading web apps and service standard, covering traditional and modern application architecture, and agile security practices and DevSecOps culture.\n"},"0x03-Using-ASVS.html":{"url":"0x03-Using-ASVS.html","title":"Using-ASVS","keywords":"","body":"Using the ASVS\nASVS has two main goals:\n\nto help organizations develop and maintain secure applications.\nto allow security service vendors, security tools vendors, and consumers to align their requirements and offerings.\n\nApplication Security Verification Levels\nThe Application Security Verification Standard defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth.\n\nASVS Level 1 is for low assurance levels, and is completely penetration testable\nASVS Level 2 is for applications that contain sensitive data, which requires protection and is the recommended level for most apps\nASVS Level 3 is for the most critical applications - applications that perform high value transactions, contain sensitive medical data, or any application that requires the highest level of trust.\n\nEach ASVS level contains a list of security requirements. Each of these requirements can also be mapped to security-specific features and capabilities that must be built into software by developers.\n\nFigure 1 - OWASP Application Security Verification Standard 4.0 Levels\nLevel 1 is the only level that is completely penetration testable using humans. All others require access to documentation, source code, configuration, and the people involved in the development process. However, even if L1 allows \"black box\" (no documentation and no source) testing to occur, it is not an effective assurance activity and should be actively discouraged. Malicious attackers have a great deal of time, most penetration tests are over within a couple of weeks. Defenders need to build in security controls, protect, find and resolve all weaknesses, and detect and respond to malicious actors in a reasonable time. Malicious actors have essentially infinite time and only require a single porous defense, a single weakness, or missing detection to succeed. Black box testing, often performed at the end of development, quickly, or not at all, is completely unable to cope with that asymmetry.\nOver the last 30+ years, black box testing has proven over and over again to miss critical security issues that led directly to ever more massive breaches. We strongly encourage the use of a wide range of security assurance and verification, including replacing penetration tests with source code led (hybrid) penetration tests at Level 1, with full access to developers and documentation throughout the development process. Financial regulators do not tolerate external financial audits with no access to the books, sample transactions, or the people performing the controls. Industry and governments must demand the same standard of transparency in the software engineering field.\nWe strongly encourage the use of security tools within the development process itself. DAST and SAST tools can be used continuously by the build pipeline to find easy to find security issues that should never be present.\nAutomated tools and online scans are unable to complete more than half of the ASVS without human assistance. If comprehensive test automation for each build is required, then a combination of custom unit and integration tests, along with build initiated online scans are used. Business logic flaws and access control testing is only possible using human assistance. These should be turned into unit and integration tests.\nHow to use this standard\nOne of the best ways to use the Application Security Verification Standard is to use it as a blueprint to create a Secure Coding Checklist specific to your application, platform or organization. Tailoring the ASVS to your use cases will increase the focus on the security requirements that are most important to your projects and environments.\nLevel 1 - First steps, automated, or whole of portfolio view\nAn application achieves ASVS Level 1 if it adequately defends against application security vulnerabilities that are easy to discover, and included in the OWASP Top 10 and other similar checklists.\nLevel 1 is the bare minimum that all applications should strive for. It is also useful as a first step in a multi-phase effort or when applications do not store or handle sensitive data and therefore do not need the more rigorous controls of Level 2 or 3. Level 1 controls can be checked either automatically by tools or simply manually without access to source code. We consider Level 1 the minimum required for all applications.\nThreats to the application will most likely be from attackers who are using simple and low effort techniques to identify easy-to-find and easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities. This is in contrast to a determined attacker who will spend focused energy to specifically target the application. If data processed by your application has high value, you would rarely want to stop at a Level 1 review.\nLevel 2 - Most applications\nAn application achieves ASVS Level 2 (or Standard) if it adequately defends against most of the risks associated with software today.\nLevel 2 ensures that security controls are in place, effective, and used within the application. Level 2 is typically appropriate for applications that handle significant business-to-business transactions, including those that process healthcare information, implement business-critical or sensitive functions, or process other sensitive assets, or industries where integrity is a critical facet to protect their business, such as the game industry to thwart cheaters and game hacks.\nThreats to Level 2 applications will typically be skilled and motivated attackers focusing on specific targets using tools and techniques that are highly practiced and effective at discovering and exploiting weaknesses within applications.\nLevel 3 - High value, high assurance, or high safety\nASVS Level 3 is the highest level of verification within the ASVS. This level is typically reserved for applications that require significant levels of security verification, such as those that may be found within areas of military, health and safety, critical infrastructure, etc.\nOrganizations may require ASVS Level 3 for applications that perform critical functions, where failure could significantly impact the organization's operations, and even its survivability. Example guidance on the application of ASVS Level 3 is provided below. An application achieves ASVS Level 3 (or Advanced) if it adequately defends against advanced application security vulnerabilities and also demonstrates principles of good security design.\nAn application at ASVS Level 3 requires more in depth analysis of architecture, coding, and testing than all the other levels. A secure application is modularized in a meaningful way (to facilitate resiliency, scalability, and most of all, layers of security), and each module (separated by network connection and/or physical instance) takes care of its own security responsibilities (defense in depth), that need to be properly documented. Responsibilities include controls for ensuring confidentiality (e.g. encryption), integrity (e.g. transactions, input validation), availability (e.g. handling load gracefully), authentication (including between systems), non-repudiation, authorization, and auditing (logging).\nApplying ASVS in Practice\nDifferent threats have different motivations. Some industries have unique information and technology assets and domain specific regulatory compliance requirements.\nOrganizations are strongly encouraged to look deeply at their unique risk characteristics based on the nature of their business, and based upon that risk and business requirements determine the appropriate ASVS level.\nHow to Reference ASVS Requirements\nEach requirement has an identifier in the format .. where each element is a number, for example: 1.11.3.\n\nThe  value corresponds to the chapter from which the requirement comes, for example: all 1.#.# requirements are from the Architecture chapter.\nThe  value corresponds to the section within that chapter where the requirement appears, for example: all 1.11.# requirements are in the Business Logic Architectural Requirements section of the Architecture chapter.\nThe  value identifies the specific requirement within the chapter and section, for example: 1.11.3 which as of version 4.0.2 of this standard is:\n\n\nVerify that all high-value business logic flows, including authentication, session management and access control are thread safe and resistant to time-of-check and time-of-use race conditions.\n\nThe identifiers may change between versions of the standard therefore it is preferable that other documents, reports, or tools use the format: v-.., where: 'version' is the ASVS version tag. For example: v4.0.2-1.11.3 would be understood to mean specifically the 3rd requirement in the 'Business Logic Architectural Requirements' section of the 'Architecture' chapter from version 4.0.2. (This could be summarized as v-.)\nNote: The v preceding the version portion is to be lower case.\nIf identifiers are used without including the v element then they should be assumed to refer to the latest Application Security Verification Standard content. Obviously as the standard grows and changes this becomes problematic, which is why writers or developers should include the version element.\nASVS requirement lists are made available in CSV, JSON, and other formats which may be useful for reference or programmatic use.\n"},"0x04-Assessment_and_Certification.html":{"url":"0x04-Assessment_and_Certification.html","title":"Assessment_and_Certification","keywords":"","body":"Assessment and Certification\nOWASP's Stance on ASVS Certifications and Trust Marks\nOWASP, as a vendor-neutral not-for-profit organization, does not currently certify any vendors, verifiers or software.\nAll such assurance assertions, trust marks, or certifications are not officially vetted, registered, or certified by OWASP, so an organization relying upon such a view needs to be cautious of the trust placed in any third party or trust mark claiming ASVS certification.\nThis should not inhibit organizations from offering such assurance services, as long as they do not claim official OWASP certification.\nGuidance for Certifying Organizations\nThe Application Security Verification Standard can be used as an open book verification of the application, including open and unfettered access to key resources such as architects and developers, project documentation, source code, authenticated access to test systems (including access to one or more accounts in each role), particularly for L2 and L3 verifications.\nHistorically, penetration testing and secure code reviews have included issues “by exception” - that is only failed tests appear in the final report. A certifying organization must include in any report the scope of the verification (particularly if a key component is out of scope, such as SSO authentication), a summary of verification findings, including passed and failed tests, with clear indications of how to resolve the failed tests.\nCertain verification requirements may not be applicable to the application under test. For example, if you provide a stateless service layer API without a client implementation to your customers, many of the requirements in V3 Session Management are not directly applicable. In such cases, a certifying organization may still claim full ASVS compliance, but must clearly indicate in any report a reason for non-applicability of such excluded verification requirements.\nKeeping detailed work papers, screenshots or movies, scripts to reliably and repeatedly exploit an issue, and electronic records of testing, such as intercepting proxy logs and associated notes such as a cleanup list, is considered standard industry practice and can be really useful as proofs of the findings for the most doubtful developers. It is not sufficient to simply run a tool and report on the failures; this does not (at all) provide sufficient evidence that all issues at a certifying level have been tested and tested thoroughly. In case of dispute, there should be sufficient assurance evidence to demonstrate each and every verified requirement has indeed been tested.\nTesting Method\nCertifying organizations are free to choose the appropriate testing method(s), but should indicate them in a report.\nDepending on the application under test and the verification requirement, different testing methods may be used to gain similar confidence in the results. For example, validating the effectiveness of an application's input verification mechanisms may either be analysed with a manual penetration test or by means of source code analyses.\nThe Role of Automated Security Testing Tools\nThe use of automated penetration testing tools is encouraged to provide as much coverage as possible.\nIt is not possible to fully complete ASVS verification using automated penetration testing tools alone. Whilst a large majority of requirements in L1 can be performed using automated tests, the overall majority of requirements are not amenable to automated penetration testing.\nPlease note that the lines between automated and manual testing have blurred as the application security industry matures. Automated tools are often manually tuned by experts and manual testers often leverage a wide variety of automated tools.\nThe Role of Penetration Testing\nIn version 4.0, we decided to make L1 completely penetration testable without access to source code, documentation, or developers. Two logging items, which are required to comply with OWASP Top 10 2017 A10, will require interviews, screenshots or other evidence collection, just as they do in the OWASP Top 10 2017. However, testing without access to necessary information is not an ideal method of security verification, as it misses out on the possibility of reviewing the source, identifying threats and missing controls, and performing a far more thorough test in a shorter timeframe. \nWhere possible, access to developers, documentation, code, and access to a test application with non-production data, is required when performing a L2 or L3 Assessment. Penetration testing done at these levels requires this level of access, which we call \"hybrid reviews\" or \"hybrid penetration tests\". \nOther uses for the ASVS\nAside from being used to assess the security of an application, we have identified a number of other potential uses for the ASVS.\nAs Detailed Security Architecture Guidance\nOne of the more common uses for the Application Security Verification Standard is as a resource for security architects. The Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) is missing a great deal of information that is necessary to complete a thorough application security architecture review. ASVS can be used to fill in those gaps by allowing security architects to choose better controls for common problems, such as data protection patterns and input validation strategies.\nAs a Replacement for Off-the-shelf Secure Coding Checklists\nMany organizations can benefit from adopting the ASVS, by choosing one of the three levels, or by forking ASVS and changing what is required for each application risk level in a domain specific way. We encourage this type of forking as long as traceability is maintained, so that if an app has passed requirement 4.1, this means the same thing for forked copies as the standard as it evolves.\nAs a Guide for Automated Unit and Integration Tests\nThe ASVS is designed to be highly testable, with the sole exception of architectural and malicious code requirements. By building unit and integration tests that test for specific and relevant fuzz and abuse cases, the application becomes nearly self-verifying with each and every build. For example, additional tests can be crafted for the test suite for a login controller, testing the username parameter for common default usernames, account enumeration, brute forcing, LDAP and SQL injection, and XSS. Similarly, a test on the password parameter should include common passwords, password length, null byte injection, removing the parameter, XSS, and more.\nFor Secure Development Training\nASVS can also be used to define characteristics of secure software. Many “secure coding” courses are simply ethical hacking courses with a light smear of coding tips. This may not necessarily help developers to write more secure code. Instead, secure development courses can use the ASVS with a strong focus on the proactive controls found in the ASVS, rather than the Top 10 negative things not to do.\nAs a Driver for Agile Application Security\nASVS can be used in an agile development process as a framework to define specific tasks that need to be implemented by the team to have a secure product. One approach might be: Starting with Level 1, verify the specific application or system according to ASVS requirements for the specified level, find what controls are missing and raise specific tickets/tasks in the backlog. This helps with prioritization of specific tasks (or grooming), and makes security visible in the agile process. This can also be used to prioritize auditing and reviewing tasks in the organization, where a specific ASVS requirement can be a driver for review, refactor or auditing for a specific team member and visible as \"debt\" in the backlog that needs to be eventually done.\nAs a Framework for Guiding the Procurement of Secure Software\nASVS is a great framework to help with secure software procurement or procurement of custom development services. The buyer can simply set a requirement that the software they wish to procure must be developed at ASVS level X, and request that the seller proves that the software satisfies ASVS level X. This works well when combined with the OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex\n"},"0x10-V1-Architecture.html":{"url":"0x10-V1-Architecture.html","title":"V1-Architecture","keywords":"","body":"V1: Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements\nControl Objective\nSecurity architecture has almost become a lost art in many organizations. The days of the enterprise architect have passed in the age of DevSecOps. The application security field must catch up and adopt agile security principles while re-introducing leading security architecture principles to software practitioners. Architecture is not an implementation, but a way of thinking about a problem that has potentially many different answers, and no one single \"correct\" answer. All too often, security is seen as inflexible and demanding that developers fix code in a particular way, when the developers may know a much better way to solve the problem. There is no single, simple solution for architecture, and to pretend otherwise is a disservice to the software engineering field.\nA specific implementation of a web application is likely to be revised continuously throughout its lifetime, but the overall architecture will likely rarely change but evolve slowly. Security architecture is identical - we need authentication today, we will require authentication tomorrow, and we will need it five years from now. If we make sound decisions today, we can save a lot of effort, time, and money if we select and re-use architecturally compliant solutions. For example, a decade ago, multi-factor authentication was rarely implemented.\nIf developers had invested in a single, secure identity provider model, such as SAML federated identity, the identity provider could be updated to incorporate new requirements such as NIST 800-63 compliance, while not changing the interfaces of the original application. If many applications shared the same security architecture and thus that same component, they all benefit from this upgrade at once. However, SAML will not always remain as the best or most suitable authentication solution - it might need to be swapped out for other solutions as requirements change. Changes like this are either complicated, so costly as to necessitate a complete re-write, or outright impossible without security architecture.\nIn this chapter, the ASVS covers off the primary aspects of any sound security architecture: availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, non-repudiation, and privacy. Each of these security principles must be built in and be innate to all applications. It is critical to \"shift left\", starting with developer enablement with secure coding checklists, mentoring and training, coding and testing, building, deployment, configuration, and operations, and finishing with follow up independent testing to assure that all of the security controls are present and functional. The last step used to be everything we did as an industry, but that is no longer sufficient when developers push code into production tens or hundreds of times a day. Application security professionals must keep up with agile techniques, which means adopting developer tools, learning to code, and working with developers rather than criticizing the project months after everyone else has moved on.\nV1.1 Secure Software Development Lifecycle Requirements\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1\nVerify the use of a secure software development lifecycle that addresses security in all stages of development.

The trust boundary is still concerning - making decisions on untrusted browsers or client devices is bypassable. However, in mainstream architectural deployments today, the trust enforcement point has dramatically changed. Therefore, where the term \"trusted service layer\" is used in the ASVS, we mean any trusted enforcement point, regardless of location, such as a microservice, serverless API, server-side, a trusted API on a client device that has secure boot, partner or external APIs, and so on.\nThe \"untrusted client\" term here refers to client-side technologies that render the presentation layer, commonly refered to as 'front-end' technologies.

Encrypting everything is wasteful, not encrypting anything is legally negligent. A balance must be struck, usually during architectural or high level design, design sprints or architectural spikes. Designing cryptography as you go or retrofitting it will inevitably cost much more to implement securely than simply building it in from the start.\nArchitectural requirements are intrinsic to the entire code base, and thus difficult to unit or integrate test.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) was commonly accepted in security circles but rarely required elsewhere. As the number of password breaches increased, the idea that usernames are somehow confidential and passwords unknown, rendered many security controls untenable. For example, NIST 800-63 considers usernames and Knowledge Based Authentication (KBA) as public information, SMS and email notifications as \"restricted\" authenticator types , and passwords as pre-breached. This reality renders knowledge based authenticators, SMS and email recovery, password history, complexity, and rotation controls useless. These controls always have been less than helpful, often forcing users to come up with weak passwords every few months, but with the release of over 5 billion username and password breaches, it's time to move on.\nOf all the chapters in the ASVS, the authentication and session management chapters have changed the most. Adoption of effective, evidence-based leading practice will be challenging for many, and that's perfectly okay. We have to start the transition to a post-password future now.\nNIST 800-63 - Modern, evidence-based authentication standard\nNIST 800-63b is a modern, evidence-based standard, and represents the best advice available, regardless of applicability. The standard is helpful for all organizations all over the world but is particularly relevant to US agencies and those dealing with US agencies.\nNIST 800-63 terminology can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're only used to username + password authentication. Advancements in modern authentication are necessary, so we have to introduce terminology that will become commonplace in the future, but we do understand the difficulty in understanding until the industry settles on these new terms. We have provided a glossary at the end of this chapter to assist. We have rephrased many requirements to satisfy the intent of the requirement, rather than the letter of the requirement. For example, the ASVS uses the term \"password\" when NIST uses \"memorized secret\" throughout this standard.\nASVS V2 Authentication, V3 Session Management, and to a lesser extent, V4 Access Controls have been adapted to be a compliant subset of selected NIST 800-63b controls, focused around common threats and commonly exploited authentication weaknesses. Where full NIST 800-63 compliance is required, please consult NIST 800-63.\nSelecting an appropriate NIST AAL Level\nThe Application Security Verification Standard has tried to map ASVS L1 to NIST AAL1 requirements, L2 to AAL2, and L3 to AAL3. However, the approach of ASVS Level 1 as \"essential\" controls may not necessarily be the correct AAL level to verify an application or API. For example, if the application is a Level 3 application or has regulatory requirements to be AAL3, Level 3 should be chosen in chapters V2 and V3 Session Management. The choice of NIST compliant Authentication Assertion Level (AAL) should be performed as per NIST 800-63b guidelines as set out in Selecting AAL in NIST 800-63b Section 6.2.\nLegend\nApplications can always exceed the current level's requirements, especially if modern authentication is on an application's roadmap. Previously, the ASVS has required mandatory MFA. NIST does not require mandatory MFA. Therefore, we have used an optional designation in this chapter to indicate where the ASVS encourages but does not require a control.

They are generally considered \"something you know\", and often used as single-factor authenticators. There are significant challenges to the continued use of single-factor authentication, including billions of valid usernames and passwords disclosed on the Internet, default or weak passwords, rainbow tables and ordered dictionaries of the most common passwords.\nApplications should strongly encourage users to enroll in multi-factor authentication, and should allow users to re-use tokens they already possess, such as FIDO or U2F tokens, or link to a credential service provider that provides multi-factor authentication.\nCredential Service Providers (CSPs) provide federated identity for users. Users will often have more than one identity with multiple CSPs, such as an enterprise identity using Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity or Google, or consumer identity using Facebook, Twitter, Google, or WeChat, to name a just few common alternatives. This list is not an endorsement of these companies or services, but simply an encouragement for developers to consider the reality that many users have many established identities. Organizations should consider integrating with existing user identities, as per the risk profile of the CSP's strength of identity proofing. For example, it is unlikely a government organization would accept a social media identity as a login for sensitive systems, as it is easy to create fake or throw away identities, whereas a mobile game company may well need to integrate with major social media platforms to grow their active player base.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1\nVerify that user set passwords are at least 12 characters in length (after multiple spaces are combined).

Another reason for including the requirement is to deter or prevent test reports unnecessarily requiring organizations to override built-in platform password field behavior to remove this modern user-friendly security experience.\nV2.2 General Authenticator Requirements\nAuthenticator agility is essential to future-proof applications. Refactor application verifiers to allow additional authenticators as per user preferences, as well as allowing retiring deprecated or unsafe authenticators in an orderly fashion.\nNIST considers email and SMS as \"restricted\" authenticator types, and they are likely to be removed from NIST 800-63 and thus the ASVS at some point the future. Applications should plan a roadmap that does not require the use of email or SMS.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1\nVerify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks. Such controls include blocking the most common breached passwords, soft lockouts, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts, IP address restrictions, or risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a device, recent attempts to unlock the account, or similar. Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts per hour is possible on a single account.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n307\n5.2.2 / 5.1.1.2 / 5.1.4.2 / 5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.2.2\nVerify that the use of weak authenticators (such as SMS and email) is limited to secondary verification and transaction approval and not as a replacement for more secure authentication methods.

The use of push notifications - rather than SMS or email - is preferred, but in the absence of push notifications, SMS or email is acceptable as long as no sensitive information is disclosed in the notification.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n620\n\n\n\n2.2.4\nVerify impersonation resistance against phishing, such as the use of multi-factor authentication, cryptographic devices with intent (such as connected keys with a push to authenticate), or at higher AAL levels, client-side certificates.\n\n\n✓\n308\n5.2.5\n\n\n2.2.5\nVerify that where a Credential Service Provider (CSP) and the application verifying authentication are separated, mutually authenticated TLS is in place between the two endpoints.\n\n\n✓\n319\n5.2.6\n\n\n2.2.6\nVerify replay resistance through the mandated use of One-time Passwords (OTP) devices, cryptographic authenticators, or lookup codes.\n\n\n✓\n308\n5.2.8\n\n\n2.2.7\nVerify intent to authenticate by requiring the entry of an OTP token or user-initiated action such as a button press on a FIDO hardware key.\n\n\n✓\n308\n5.2.9\n\n\n\nV2.3 Authenticator Lifecycle Requirements\nAuthenticators are passwords, soft tokens, hardware tokens, and biometric devices. The lifecycle of authenticators is critical to the security of an application - if anyone can self-register an account with no evidence of identity, there can be little trust in the identity assertion. For social media sites like Reddit, that's perfectly okay. For banking systems, a greater focus on the registration and issuance of credentials and devices is critical to the security of the application.\nNote: Passwords are not to have a maximum lifetime or be subject to password rotation. Passwords should be checked for being breached, not regularly replaced.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1\nVerify system generated initial passwords or activation codes SHOULD be securely randomly generated, SHOULD be at least 6 characters long, and MAY contain letters and numbers, and expire after a short period of time.

This section can only be fully verified using source code review or through  secure unit or integration tests. Penetration testing cannot identify any of these issues.\nThe list of approved one-way key derivation functions is detailed in NIST 800-63 B section 5.1.1.2, and in BSI Kryptographische Verfahren: Empfehlungen und Schlussellängen (2018). The latest national or regional algorithm and key length standards can be chosen in place of these choices.\nThis section cannot be penetration tested, so controls are not marked as L1. However, this section is of vital importance to the security of credentials if they are stolen, so if forking the ASVS for an architecture or coding guideline or source code review checklist, please place these controls back to L1 in your private version.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1\nVerify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key derivation or password hashing function. Key derivation and password hashing functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs when generating a password hash. (C6)\n\n✓\n✓\n916\n5.1.1.2\n\n\n2.4.2\nVerify that the salt is at least 32 bits in length and be chosen arbitrarily to minimize salt value collisions among stored hashes.

Generate the salt value using an approved random bit generator [SP 800-90Ar1] and provide at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of SP 800-131A. The secret salt value SHALL be stored separately from the hashed passwords (e.g., in a specialized device like a hardware security module).\n\n✓\n✓\n916\n5.1.1.2\n\n\n\nWhere US standards are mentioned, a regional or local standard can be used in place of or in addition to the US standard as required.\nV2.5 Credential Recovery Requirements\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.5.1\n[MODIFIED] Verify that if a system generated initial activation or recovery secret is being sent to the user, it is single-use, time-limited and random.

These are distributed securely to users. These lookup codes are used once, and once all used, the lookup secret list is discarded. This type of authenticator is considered \"something you have\".\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.6.1\nVerify that lookup secrets can be used only once.\n\n✓\n✓\n308\n5.1.2.2\n\n\n2.6.2\nVerify that lookup secrets have sufficient randomness (112 bits of entropy), or if less than 112 bits of entropy, salted with a unique and random 32-bit salt and hashed with an approved one-way hash.\n\n✓\n✓\n330\n5.1.2.2\n\n\n2.6.3\nVerify that lookup secrets are resistant to offline attacks, such as predictable values.\n\n✓\n✓\n310\n5.1.2.2\n\n\n\nV2.7 Out of Band Verifier Requirements\nIn the past, a common out of band verifier would have been an email or SMS containing a password reset link. Attackers use this weak mechanism to reset accounts they don't yet control, such as taking over a person's email account and re-using any discovered reset links. There are better ways to handle out of band verification.\nSecure out of band authenticators are physical devices that can communicate with the verifier over a secure secondary channel. Examples include push notifications to mobile devices. This type of authenticator is considered \"something you have\". When a user wishes to authenticate, the verifying application sends a message to the out of band authenticator via a connection to the authenticator directly or indirectly through a third party service. The message contains an authentication code (typically a random six digit number or a modal approval dialog). The verifying application waits to receive the authentication code through the primary channel and compares the hash of the received value to the hash of the original authentication code. If they match, the out of band verifier can assume that the user has authenticated.\nThe ASVS assumes that only a few developers will be developing new out of band authenticators, such as push notifications, and thus the following ASVS controls apply to verifiers, such as authentication API, applications, and single sign-on implementations. If developing a new out of band authenticator, please refer to NIST 800-63B § 5.1.3.1.\nUnsafe out of band authenticators such as e-mail and VOIP are not permitted. PSTN and SMS authentication are currently \"restricted\" by NIST and should be deprecated in favor of push notifications or similar. If you need to use telephone or SMS out of band authentication, please see § 5.1.3.3.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.7.1\nVerify that clear text out of band (NIST \"restricted\") authenticators, such as SMS or PSTN, are not offered by default, and stronger alternatives such as push notifications are offered first.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n287\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n2.7.2\nVerify that the out of band verifier expires out of band authentication requests, codes, or tokens after 10 minutes.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n287\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n2.7.3\nVerify that the out of band verifier authentication requests, codes, or tokens are only usable once, and only for the original authentication request.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n287\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n2.7.4\nVerify that the out of band authenticator and verifier communicates over a secure independent channel.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n523\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n2.7.5\nVerify that the out of band verifier retains only a hashed version of the authentication code.\n\n✓\n✓\n256\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n2.7.6\nVerify that the initial authentication code is generated by a secure random number generator, containing at least 20 bits of entropy (typically a six digital random number is sufficient).\n\n✓\n✓\n310\n5.1.3.2\n\n\n\nV2.8 Single or Multi-factor One Time Verifier Requirements\nSingle-factor One-time Passwords (OTPs) are physical or soft tokens that display a continually changing pseudo-random one-time challenge. These devices make phishing (impersonation) difficult, but not impossible. This type of authenticator is considered \"something you have\". Multi-factor tokens are similar to single-factor OTPs, but require a valid PIN code, biometric unlocking, USB insertion or NFC pairing or some additional value (such as transaction signing calculators) to be entered to create the final OTP.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.8.1\nVerify that time-based OTPs have a defined lifetime before expiring.\n✓\n✓\n✓\n613\n5.1.4.2 / 5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.8.2\nVerify that symmetric keys used to verify submitted OTPs are highly protected, such as by using a hardware security module or secure operating system based key storage.\n\n✓\n✓\n320\n5.1.4.2 / 5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.8.3\nVerify that approved cryptographic algorithms are used in the generation, seeding, and verification of OTPs.\n\n✓\n✓\n326\n5.1.4.2 / 5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.8.4\nVerify that time-based OTP can be used only once within the validity period.\n\n✓\n✓\n287\n5.1.4.2 / 5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.8.5\nVerify that if a time-based multi-factor OTP token is re-used during the validity period, it is logged and rejected with secure notifications being sent to the holder of the device.\n\n✓\n✓\n287\n5.1.5.2\n\n\n2.8.6\nVerify physical single-factor OTP generator can be revoked in case of theft or other loss.

Verifiers send a challenge nonce to the cryptographic devices or software, and the device or software calculates a response based upon a securely stored cryptographic key.\nThe requirements for single-factor cryptographic devices and software, and multi-factor cryptographic devices and software are the same, as verification of the cryptographic authenticator proves possession of the authentication factor.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.9.1\nVerify that cryptographic keys used in verification are stored securely and protected against disclosure, such as using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or Hardware Security Module (HSM), or an OS service that can use this secure storage.\n\n✓\n✓\n320\n5.1.7.2\n\n\n2.9.2\n[L2>L3] Verify that the challenge nonce is at least 64 bits in length, and statistically unique or unique over the lifetime of the cryptographic device.\n\n\n✓\n330\n5.1.7.2\n\n\n2.9.3\nVerify that approved cryptographic algorithms are used in the generation, seeding, and verification.\n\n✓\n✓\n327\n5.1.7.2\n\n\n\nV2.10 Service Authentication Requirements\nThis section is not penetration testable, so does not have any L1 requirements. However, if used in an architecture, coding or secure code review, please assume that software (just as Java Key Store) is the minimum requirement at L1. Clear text storage of secrets is not acceptable under any circumstances.\n\n\n\n#\nDescription\nL1\nL2\nL3\nCWE\nNIST §\n\n\n\n\n2.10.1\nVerify that intra-service secrets do not rely on unchanging credentials such as passwords, API keys or shared accounts with privileged access.\n\nOS assisted\nHSM\n287\n5.1.1.1\n\n\n2.10.2\nVerify that if passwords are required for service authentication, the service account used is not a default credential.

Such storage SHOULD resist offline attacks. The use of a secure software key store (L1), hardware TPM, or an HSM (L3) is recommended for password storage.\n\nOS assisted\nHSM\n798\n\n\n\nAdditional US Agency Requirements\nUS Agencies have mandatory requirements concerning NIST 800-63. The Application Security Verification Standard has always been about the 80% of controls that apply to nearly 100% of apps, and not the last 20% of advanced controls or those that have limited applicability. As such, the ASVS is a strict subset of NIST 800-63, especially for IAL1/2 and AAL1/2 classifications, but is not sufficiently comprehensive, particularly concerning IAL3/AAL3 classifications.\nWe strongly urge US government agencies to review and implement NIST 800-63 in its entirety.\nGlossary of terms\n\n\n\nTerm\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nCSP\nCredential Service Provider also called an Identity Provider\n\n\nAuthenticator\nCode that authenticates a password, token, MFA, federated assertion, and so on.\n\n\nVerifier\n\"An entity that verifies the claimant's identity by verifying the claimant's possession and control of one or two authenticators using an authentication protocol.

Previously, based on ISO 27002 requirements, the ASVS has required blocking multiple simultaneous sessions. Blocking simultaneous sessions is no longer appropriate, not only as modern users have many devices or the app is an API without a browser session, but in most of these implementations, the last authenticator wins, which is often the attacker. This section provides leading guidance on deterring, delaying and detecting session management attacks using code.\nDescription of the half-open Attack\nIn early 2018, several financial institutions were compromised using what the attackers called \"half-open attacks\". This term has stuck in the industry. The attackers struck multiple institutions with different proprietary code bases, and indeed it seems different code bases within the same institutions. The half-open attack is exploiting a design pattern flaw commonly found in many existing authentication, session management and access control systems.\nAttackers start a half-open attack by attempting to lock, reset, or recover a credential. A popular session management design pattern re-uses user profile session objects/models between unauthenticated, half-authenticated (password resets, forgot username), and fully authenticated code.

SAST solutions analyze an application from the “inside out” in a nonrunning state.\nSoftware development lifecycle (SDLC) - The step by step process by which software is developed going from the initial requirements to deployment and maintainance.\nSecurity Architecture – An abstraction of an application's design that identifies and describes where and how security controls are used, and also identifies and describes the location and sensitivity of both user and application data.\nSecurity Configuration – The runtime configuration of an application that affects how security controls are used.\nSecurity Control – A function or component that performs a security check (e.g. an access control check) or when called results in a security effect (e.g. generating an audit record).\nServer-side Request Forgery (SSRF) - An attack which abuses functionality on the server to read or update internal resources by supplying or modifying a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data to.\nSingle Sign-on Authentication (SSO) - This occurs when a user logs into one application and is then automatically logged in to other applications without having to re-authenticate. For example, when you login to Google, when accessing other Google services such as YouTube, Google Docs, and Gmail you will be automatically logged in.\nSQL Injection (SQLi) – A code injection technique used to attack data driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry point.\nSVG - Scalable Vector Graphics\nTime-based OTP - A method of generating an OTP where the current time acts as part of the algorithm to generate the password.\nThreat Modeling - A technique consisting of developing increasingly refined security architectures to identify threat agents, security zones, security controls, and important technical and business assets.\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) – Cryptographic protocols that provide communication security over a network connection\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM) - A type of HSM which is usually attached to a larger hardware component such as a motherboard and acts as the \"root of trust\" for that system.\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) - This adds a second level of authentication to an account log-in.\nUniversal 2nd Factor (U2F) - One of the standards created by FIDO specifically for allowing a USB or NFC security key to be used as a 2nd authentication factor.\nURI/URL/URL fragments – A Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to identify a name or a web resource. A Uniform Resource Locator is often used as a reference to a resource.\nVerifier – The person or team that is reviewing an application against the OWASP ASVS requirements.\nWhat You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) - A type of rich content editor which shows how the content will actually look when rendered rather than showing the coding used to govern the rendering.\nX.509 Certificate – An X.509 certificate is a digital certificate that uses the widely accepted international X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI) standard to verify that a public key belongs to the user, computer or service identity contained within the certificate.\nXML eXternal Entity (XXE) - A type of XML entity that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier.
