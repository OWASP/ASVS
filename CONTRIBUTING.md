**This document has been updated for the version 5.0 release candidate stage in 2025 and may change at a future date.**

## Introduction

### What is [OWASP](https://owasp.org/)?

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit organization that works to improve the security of software. It has many programs to work towards this goal. One of those programs is the ASVS.

### What is the [ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)?

The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.

The primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard.

### What is the Current Status of ASVS development?

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ **We are now at the RC1 stage of ASVS version 5.0!** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

The ASVS project will release a 5.0 version during May 2025 which is a complete revamp compared to the previous version 4.0.3.

We are waiting for your feedback on a release candidate version of 5.0! You can see this version on the master branch within the 5.0 folder. This branch will continue to be updated during the review process so we recommend always working from the latest version

We will no longer be accepting changes to the 4.0 folder which is now fixed at the 4.0.3 release.

## How can I help?

Reading through the release candidate version of ASVS is a great place to start.

A few questions to ask yourself as you review the document:

* If I was a developer or a security tester, would this requirement understandable to me?
* Can I think of a way of improving front / chapter / section text to add clarity without adding unnecessary content.

Please first log ideas, issues or questions here: <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues>. Itâ€™s helpful to share if you have any ideas or if you find any bugs or typos (but see the extra guidance below).

We may subsequently ask you to open a pull request, <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pulls>, based on the discussion in the issue. 

After familiarizing yourself with the current version and if you don't have additional questions or feedback, the next area to focus on is the "Issues" section. 

The issues to focus on for RC1 are listed here:

- [![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3AOWASP%2FASVS%20label%3A%22_5.0%20-%20rc1%22%20state%3Aopen&label=_5.0%20-%20rc1&labelColor=%2399F2D1&color=grey)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22_5.0%20-%20rc1%22)

## Additional Details for Helping

### Before you open a Pull Request

Please do not open a pull request without first opening an associated issue. Please do not open an issue until you have used the search functionality to ensure that the issue has not previously been discussed and that there are no currently open issues relating to it. For example, [this link](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+bcrypt) searches for issues (open and closed) related to bcrypt.

Note that since there was a major renumbering recently, a lot of the requirement numbers in the issues may be different. You should also therefore search in the issues for the requirements based on two other sources of requirment numbers:

1) Each requirement has a column at the end called "#v5.0.be". This contains the number before the numbering.
2) If you are looking for how a requirement was numbered in v4.0.3 (which may also be used in the issues), there is a [mapping page](https://asvs.dev/mapping_v5.0.0_to_v4.0.3.html) which maps between the current number and the number from v4.0.3.
    -  There are also other mappings in the [`5.0/mappings/`](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/mappings/) folder but these may not be kept up to date.

If you are comfortable that your query has  has not been previously discussed, you can open an issue. Please try and include the ASVS text you are talking about in the issue (or at least the value of the "#v5.0.be" column) to save having to jump back and forth and please carry out all discussion in the associated issue and not in a PR discussion.

### How to suggest changes to the release candidate during this period

Note that review and changes should always be made based on the raw .md files. The other output formats have not yet been updated.

To help those who are using the "bleeding edge" version for their tests and in order to be able to track changes made during this period, we have prepared a set of labels to be used when making changes to the "bleeding edge" version during this time. The current bleeding edge working directory can be found here <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/tree/master/5.0/en>.

# Mapping between v4.0.3 and v5.0.0

For a smooth transfer from ASVS v4.0.3 to v5.0.0, it is good to know:

  * What happened with the requirement from v4.0.3?
  * Is the requirement in v5.0.0 originating from any requirement from v4.0.3, or is it completely new?

Through the 5.5 years from the last release, the changes are tracked and tagged and give the possibility to provide 2-way mapping now.

Note that requirement numbers for v5.0.0 may change till it is released (it is too early to make "a final copy" of the mapping).

Mappings are presented in a separate `yml` file. How those mapping files can be used, a sample output is also provided on asvs.dev:

  * Mapping from v4.0.3 to v5.0.0:
    * <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/5.0/mappings/mapping_v4.0.3_to_v5.0.0.yml> - mapping file
    * <https://asvs.dev/mapping_v4.0.3_to_v5.0.0.html> - visual overview of changes
  * Mapping from v5.0.0 to v4.0.3:
    * <https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/5.0/mappings/mapping_v5.0.0_to_v4.0.3.yml> - mapping file
    * <https://asvs.dev/mapping_v5.0.0_to_v4.0.3.html> - visual overview of changes

Tags in new (v5.0.0) mapping file:

  * `ADDED` - new requirement
  * `MOVED FROM x.y.z` - reference to the requirement in the old version. Must have a matching `MOVE TO` tag in the old version.
    * `MODIFIED` - marks, was the moved requirement also modified (more than just a language or grammar change)
    * `GRAMMAR` - marks, was the moved requirement modified only on the language or grammar correction level
  * `SPLIT FROM x.y.z` - In the old version requirement was split. Must have matching `SPLIT TO` in old version.
  * `MERGED FROM x.y.z` - requirement has been merged from another requirement from the old version. Must have a matching `MERGED TO` tag in the old version.
  * `COVERS x.y.z` - covers the requirement in the old version. Must have a matching `COVERED BY x.y.z` tag in the old version.

Tags in old (v4.0.3) mapping file:

  * `DELETED` - the requirement is deleted in the new version, with a reason
    * `DELETED, NOT IN SCOPE` - requirement has been decided to be out of the redefined scope of ASVS
    * `DELETED, INCORRECT` - requirement was invalid or provided inadvisable advice
    * `DELETED, NOT PRACTICAL` - the requirement was not practical (enough) to implement in reality
    * `DELETED, INSUFFICIENT IMPACT` - requirement provided insufficient benefit to be worthwhile
    * `DELETED, MERGED TO x.y.z` - requirement was merged to another requirement, reference to the new requirement. Must have matching `MERGED FROM` tag in new version
    * `DELETED, COVERED BY x.y.z` - The requirement was a duplicate of or is covered by another requirement in the new version. Must have matching `COVERS` tag in new version
  * `MOVED TO x.y.z` - reference to the requirement in the new version. Must have a matching `MOVED FROM` tag in the new version
  * `SPLIT TO x.y.z, i.j.k` - requirement is divided into many requirements, references to requirements in now version presenting separate parts. Must have matching `SPLIT FROM` tag in new version

### Translations

We are no longer also actively looking for translations of the 4.n branch but get ready for the final version of 5.0 which can then be translated!

<!--

NOTE: This content will be brought back in, related to 5.0 when 5.0 is ready

If you are interested in creating a translation, here are some pointers for how you can help us:

* Please first of all search the repository to see if there is already a translation for your proposed language. We currently have completed or in-progress translations in the following languages (but please search anyway in case this list is superseded!):
    * In-progress
        * None
    * v4.0.3
        * Spanish
        * Simplified Chinese
        * Arabic
        * Russian
        * French
        * German
        * Portuguese
        * Italian
    * v4.0.2
        * German
        * Russian
    * v4.0.1
        * Persian
        * Turkish
        * Japanese
* If the language you are interested in appears, it would be great if you could reach out to the translator to see if you can help them.
* Often there is work to do in creating markdown files or updating the translation to keep it up to date with latest changes.
* We would request that you base your translation on the 4.0/en folder in the master branch as this is now static at the 4.0.3 version.
* In order to start a translation, please start by forking the ASVS repository.
    * If you are updating an existing translation which has markdown (just French as of December 2021), you can make modifications to the files in the existing folder based on language code (just /fr as at December 2021).
    * If you are starting a new markdown translation, take a copy of the /en folder and rename it to the 2 character language code which will be used for the translation.
* When you have completed the translation, please open a Pull Request against the master ASVS branch and one of the leaders will look at integrating it.
* The leader will also use the relevant scripts to create the documents from the raw markdown (or you can if you want to save us some trouble).
* Finally, the leader will back port the translation into the branch containing the ASVS version which was targeted (at this point, presumably v4.0.3).

Thank you for your help!!
