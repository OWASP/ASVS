# Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct applies to the content since the 1st of October, 2025.

The "issuer" knows what the ASVS is about, e.g., is familiar with the content of the "What is the ASVS" (<https://asvs.dev/v5.0.0/What-is-the-ASVS/>)

A contributor needs to be polite in words and in actions.

Tone of contributions:
* Contributions must be politely worded and have a calm and professional tone.
* At the same time, when reading someone else's contributions, please assume positive intent, as not everyoneâ€™s first language is English.
* Contributions must not contain personal attacks.
* Please do not respond to contributions that violate this code of conduct, but rather report them. <!-- needs some instruction here -->

The main goal for issues is that all changes to requirements are public information, and it is possible to go back to the discussion and re-investigate the arguments.

Additionally, as the ASVS is based on volunteer work, the most valuable resource is volunteers' time. That means communication on issues requires efficiency.

* Do your best to search the issues list for previous discussions on the topic before opening a new issue, and investigate the previous issue when you are asked to do so.
* In case the issue is about existing content - quote the requirement or part of the document from the bleeding edge version from markdown
* In the discussed issue, read and analyze in detail what is written before to avoid situations like "it was already answered 2 comments before" - it causes useless content, wastes everyone's time, and makes issues complicated to follow and analyze later
* If the issue is about the requirement, the discussion must focus precisely on that requirement. If there is a side-topic evolving, it should be moved to a separate issue.
* If quoting something, please provide a source. If AI-generated content is used, it must be stated so.
* If longer text is quoted, please provide your own summary and key points, and why the content was provided. That especially applies to AI-generated responses.
* If quoting previous comments, it must be done in a way that it contains the context (e.g., avoid a partial quote that may change the meaning when used out of context)
