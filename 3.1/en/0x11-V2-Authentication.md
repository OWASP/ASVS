# V2: Authentication Verification Requirements

## Control Objective

Authentication is the act of establishing, or confirming, something (or someone) as authentic, that is, that claims made by a person or about a device are true, resistant to impersonation, and prevents recovery or interception of memorized secrets (passwords).

NIST 800-63 is a modern, evidence based standard, and represents the best advice available in 2018. The standard is extremely helpful for all organizations all over the world, but is particularly relevant to US agencies and those dealing with US agencies. Implementers requiring the full set of controls should review the entire standard, especially regarding evidence of identity, identity binding, identity assertion, the deployment and management of multi-factor, biometric and crypto devices, security usability, and a great deal more advanced topics.

Verifications below are selected to address modern authentication threats such as credential stuffing, phishing, breached, weak or default memorized secrets, but by necessity are not a complete set of controls. If you require full NIST 800-63 compliance, please use this list as unit or integration tests to demonstrate a sampling of essential controls. Full compliance with the ASVS 3.1 is not the same as full compliance with NIST 800-63.

ASVS V2 Authentication, V3 Session Management, and V4 Access Controls has been adapted to be a compliant subset of selected NIST 800-63 B controls, focused around commonly exploited authentication weaknesses. Previous verification requirements have been retired, de-duped, or in most cases adapted to either be identical or strongly aligned with the intent of NIST 800-63 normative (mandatory) requirements. New NIST 800-63 verifications are enumerated from V2.40 onwards.

Authentication Access Levels (AAL) replace L1 .. L3 in these chapters. You should use NIST 800-63 &sect; 6.2 to determine the correct authentication assurance level (AAL) for your application. In some cases, AAL1 weakens L1 controls as documented in previous versions of ASVS. If you wish to retain those controls, choose AAL2 or AAL3 instead as per the risk of your application.

We strongly urge everyone to adopt NIST 800-63, and align any policies, guidelines and standards with it, such as we've done here.

| **2.6** | Verify authentication controls fail securely to ensure attackers cannot log in by inducing errors or exceptions. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 1.0 | Implicit |
| **2.7** | Verifiers SHALL require memorized secrets to be at least 8 characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit memorized secrets at least 64 characters in length. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 3.1 | 5.1.1.2 |
| **2.8** | Verify all identity proofing functions (registration, login, credential reset, MFA device enrollment, lookup code entry, and so on) are secured by equivalent security controls. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 3.1 | Implicit |

| **2.12** | Verify all authentication decisions are logged, without storing sensitive session identifiers or memorized secrets. This should include requests with relevant metadata needed for security investigations.  |  | ✓ | ✓ | 3.1 | N/A |
| **2.13** | Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one way key derivation function.
