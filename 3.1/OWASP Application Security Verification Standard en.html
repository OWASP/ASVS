<h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 3.1. The ASVS is a community-effort to establish a framework of security requirements and controls that focus on normalizing the functional and non-functional security controls required when designing, developing and testing modern web applications.</p>
<p>ASVS v3.1 is a culmination of community effort and industry feedback. In this release, we felt it was important to qualify the experiences of real world use cases relating to ASVS adoption. This will help newcomers to the standard plan their adoption of the ASVS, whilst assisting existing companies in learning from the experience of others.</p>
<p>We expect that there will most likely never be 100% agreement on this standard. Risk analysis is always subjective to some extent, which creates a challenge when attempting to generalize in a one size fits all standard. However, we hope that the latest updates made in this version are a step in the right direction, and respectfully enhance the concepts introduced in this important industry standard.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-31">What’s new in 3.1</h2>
<p>The single largest change in this version is the adoption of NIST 800-63, concentrating on introducing controls at authentication assurance levels 1 through 3. Although we do expect there to be some pushback on this adoption, it's important for standards to be aligned, particularly when a newer standard is evidence based.</p>
<p>We have worked to comprehensively meet and exceed OWASP Top 10 2017 requirements. As the OWASP Top 10 2017 is the bare minimum to avoid negligence, we have deliberately set nearly all of OWASP Top 10 controls to be L1. This makes it easier for OWASP Top 10 adopters to continuously improve, especially when they want to continue the security journey by building in security into every application and API.</p>
<p>We have completed the shift of the ASVS from monolithic server side only controls, to providing solid controls for all modern applications and APIs. In the days of functional programming, server less API, mobile, cloud, IoT, CI/CD and DevOps, and federation, we cannot keep on ignoring modern application architecture. Modern applications are designed differently to those in 2008, when the original ASVS was written. The ASVS must always look far into the future so that we provide sound advice for our primary audience - developers. We have clarified or dropped any requirement that assumes that security must be solely performed on a server owned by a single organization.</p>
<p>We have retired the mobile section, in favor of the Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS). As that standard does not particularly strongly elucidate API security issues, we have decided to concentrate on being the best standard for web apps and all forms of API - RESTful and SOAP web services, monolithic or micro services. Mobile application developers should see the MASVS as being highly useful for mobile client issues, and the ASVS as being highly useful for mobile APIs and micro services.</p>
<p>There is a new Internet of Things section, and during the draft phase, we will be seeking feedback if this should remain, or an IoT specific ASVS be created, again with the core ASVS focusing on the back-end APIs used by nearly all IoT. Please log issues with your views.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have de-duped and retired controls that cannot get you hacked. Over time, the ASVS started being a comprehensive set of controls, but not all controls are equal at producing secure software. We have re-validated L1 to be a &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;Essential&quot; control set, by setting a CVSS score bar of 7.5 or above to be in L1. This helps compliant organizations adhere to PCI DSS's requirements to resolve all High and Critical findings rapidly. If an application or API has a failed L1 control, it is a serious risk to any organization.</p>
<h1 id="using-the-asvs">Using the ASVS</h1>
<p>ASVS has two main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>to help organizations develop and maintain secure applications.</li>
<li>to allow security service, security tools vendors, and consumers to align their requirements and offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Application Security Verification Levels The Application Security Verification Standard defines three security verification levels, with each level increasing in depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>ASVS Level 1 is meant for all software.</li>
<li>ASVS Level 2 is for applications that contain sensitive data, which requires protection.</li>
<li>ASVS Level 3 is for the most critical applications - applications that perform high value transactions, contain sensitive medical data, or any application that requires the highest level of trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each ASVS level contains a list of security requirements. Each of these requirements can also be mapped to security-specific features and capabilities that must be built into software by developers.</p>
<p>Figure 1 - OWASP Application Security Verification Standard 3.1 Levels</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-this-standard">How to use this standard</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to use the Application Security Verification Standard is to use it as blueprint create a Secure Coding Checklist specific to your application, platform or organization. Tailoring the ASVS to your use cases will increase the focus on the security requirements that are most important to your projects and environments.</p>
<h3 id="level-1-opportunistic">Level 1: Opportunistic</h3>
<p>An application achieves ASVS Level 1 (or Opportunistic) if it adequately defends against application security vulnerabilities that are easy to discover, and included in the OWASP Top 10 and other similar checklists.</p>
<p>Level 1 is typically appropriate for applications where low confidence in the correct use of security controls is required, or to provide a quick analysis of a fleet of enterprise applications, or assisting in developing a prioritized list of security requirements as part of a multi-phase effort. Level 1 controls can be ensured either automatically by tools or simply manually without access to source code. We consider Level 1 the minimum required for all applications.</p>
<p>Threats to the application will most likely be from attackers who are using simple and low effort techniques to identify easy-to-find and easy-to-exploit vulnerabilities. This is in contrast to a determined attacker who will spend focused energy to specifically target the application. If data processed by your application has high value, you would rarely want to stop at a Level 1 review.</p>
<h3 id="level-2-standard">Level 2: Standard</h3>
<p>An application achieves ASVS Level 2 (or Standard) if it adequately defends against most of the risks associated with software today.</p>
<p>Level 2 ensures that security controls are in place, effective, and used within the application. Level 2 is typically appropriate for applications that handle significant business-to-business transactions, including those that process healthcare information, implement business-critical or sensitive functions, or process other sensitive assets.</p>
<p>Threats to Level 2 applications will typically be skilled and motivated attackers focusing on specific targets using tools and techniques that are highly practiced and effective at discovering and exploiting weaknesses within applications.</p>
<h3 id="level-3-advanced">Level 3: Advanced</h3>
<p>ASVS Level 3 is the highest level of verification within the ASVS. This level is typically reserved for applications that require significant levels of security verification, such as those that may be found within areas of military, health and safety, critical infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p>Organizations may require ASVS Level 3 for applications that perform critical functions, where failure could significantly impact the organization's operations, and even its survivability. Example guidance on the application of ASVS Level 3 is provided below. An application achieves ASVS Level 3 (or Advanced) if it adequately defends against advanced application security vulnerabilities and also demonstrates principles of good security design.</p>
<p>An application at ASVS Level 3 requires more in depth analysis, architecture, coding, and testing than all the other levels. A secure application is modularized in a meaningful way (to facilitate e.g. resiliency, scalability, and most of all, layers of security), and each module (separated by network connection and/or physical instance) takes care of its own security responsibilities (defense in depth), that need to be properly documented. Responsibilities include controls for ensuring confidentiality (e.g. encryption), integrity (e.g. transactions, input validation), availability (e.g. handling load gracefully), authentication (including between systems), non-repudiation, authorization, and auditing (logging).</p>
<h2 id="applying-asvs-in-practice">Applying ASVS in Practice</h2>
<p>Different threats have different motivations. Some industries have unique information and technology assets and domain specific regulatory compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Below we provide industry-specific guidance regarding recommended ASVS levels. Although some unique criteria and some differences in threats exist for each industry, a common theme throughout all industry segments is that opportunistic attackers will look for any easily exploitable vulnerable applications, which is why ASVS Level 1 is recommended for all applications regardless of industry. This is a suggested starting point to manage the easiest to find risks.</p>
<p>Organizations are strongly encouraged to look more deeply at their unique risk characteristics based on the nature of their business. At the other end of the spectrum is ASVS Level 3, which is reserved for those cases that might endanger human safety or when a full application breach could severely impact the organization.</p>
<p>TBD - Need to re-do case studies / applicability.</p>
<h1 id="assessment-and-certification">Assessment and Certification</h1>
<h2 id="owasps-stance-on-asvs-certifications-and-trust-marks">OWASP's Stance on ASVS Certifications and Trust Marks</h2>
<p>OWASP, as a vendor-neutral not-for-profit organization, does not currently certify any vendors, verifiers or software.</p>
<p>All such assurance assertions, trust marks, or certifications are not officially vetted, registered, or certified by OWASP, so an organization relying upon such a view needs to be cautious of the trust placed in any third party or trust mark claiming ASVS certification.</p>
<p>This should not inhibit organizations from offering such assurance services, as long as they do not claim official OWASP certification.</p>
<h2 id="guidance-for-certifying-organizations">Guidance for Certifying Organizations</h2>
<p>The Application Security Verification Standard can be used as an open book verification of the application, including open and unfettered access to key resources such as architects and developers, project documentation, source code, authenticated access to test systems (including access to at least one account in each role), particularly for L2 and L3 verifications.</p>
<p>Historically, penetration testing and secure code reviews have included issues “by exception” - that is only failed issues appear in the final report. A certifying organization must include in any report the scope of the verification (particularly if a key component is out of scope, such as SSO authentication), a summary of verification findings, including passed and failed tests, with clear indications of how to resolve the failed tests.</p>
<p>Keeping detailed work papers, screenshots or movies, scripts to reliably and repeatedly exploit an issue, and electronic records of testing, such as intercepting proxy logs and associated notes such as a cleanup list, is considered standard industry practice and can be really useful as proofs of the findings for the most doubts developers. It is not sufficient to simply run a tool and report on the failures; this does not (at all) provide sufficient evidence that all issues at a certifying level have been tested and tested thoroughly. In case of dispute, there should be sufficient assurance evidence to demonstrate each and every verified requirement has indeed been tested.</p>
<h3 id="the-role-of-automated-security-testing-tools">The Role of Automated Security Testing Tools</h3>
<p>Automated penetration tools are encouraged to provide as much as possible coverage and to exercise as many parameters as possible with many different forms of malicious inputs as possible.</p>
<p>It is not possible to fully complete ASVS verification using automated penetration testing tools alone. Whilst a large majority of requirements in L1 can be performed using automated tests, the overall majority of requirements are not amenable to automated penetration testing.</p>
<p>Please note that the lines between automated and manual testing have blurred as the application security industry matures. Automated tools are often manually tuned by experts and manual testers often leverage a wide variety of automated tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-penetration-testing">The Role of Penetration Testing</h2>
<p>It is possible to perform a manual penetration test and verify all L1 issues without requiring access to source code, but this is not a leading practice. L2 requires at least some access to developers, documentation, code, and authenticated access to the system. Complete penetration testing coverage at Level 3 is not possible, as most of the additional issues involve review of system configuration, malicious code review, threat modeling, and other non-penetration testing artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="as-detailed-security-architecture-guidance">As Detailed Security Architecture Guidance</h3>
<p>One of the more common uses for the Application Security Verification Standard is as a resource for security architects. The two major security architecture frameworks, SABSA or TOGAF, are missing a great deal of information that is necessary to complete application security architecture review. ASVS can be used to fill in those gaps by allowing security architects to choose better controls for common problems, such as data protection patterns and input validation strategies.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-replacement-for-off-the-shelf-secure-coding-checklists">As a Replacement for Off-the-shelf Secure Coding Checklists</h3>
<p>Many organizations can benefit from adopting the ASVS, by choosing one of the three levels, or by forking ASVS and changing what is required for each application risk level in a domain specific way. We encourage this type of forking as long as traceability is maintained, so that if an app has passed requirement 4.1, this means the same thing for forked copies as the standard as it evolves.</p>
<h3 id="as-a-guide-for-automated-unit-and-integration-tests">As a Guide for Automated Unit and Integration Tests</h3>
<p>The ASVS is designed to highly testable, with the sole exception of architectural and malicious code requirements. By building unit and integration tests that test for specific and relevant fuzz and abuse cases, the application becomes nearly self-verifying with each and every build. For example, additional tests can be crafted for the test suite for a login controller, testing the username parameter for common usernames, account enumeration, brute forcing, LDAP and SQL injection, and XSS. Similarly, a test on the password parameter should include common passwords, password length, null byte injection, removing the parameter, XSS, account enumeration, and more.</p>
<h3 id="for-secure-development-training">For Secure Development Training</h3>
<p>ASVS can also be used to define characteristics of secure software. Many “secure coding” courses are simply ethical hacking courses with a light smear of coding tips. This does not help developers. Instead, secure development courses can use the ASVS with a strong focus on the proactive controls found in the ASVS, rather than the Top 10 negative things not to do.</p>
<h1 id="v1-architecture-design-and-threat-modeling-requirements">V1: Architecture, Design and Threat Modeling Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="control-objective">Control Objective</h2>
<p>In a perfect world, security would be considered throughout all phases of development. In reality however, security is often only a consideration at a late stage in the SDLC. Besides the technical controls, the ASVS requires processes to be in place that ensure that the security has been explicitly addressed when planning the architecture of the application or API, and that the functional and security roles of all components are known. Since single page applications and act as clients to remote API or services, it must be ensured that appropriate security standards are also applied to those services - testing the app in isolation is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The category “V1” lists requirements pertaining to architecture and design of the app. As such, this is the only category that does not map to technical test cases in the OWASP Testing Guide. To cover topics such as threat modeling, secure SDLC, key management, users of the ASVS should consult the respective OWASP projects and/or other standards such as the ones linked below.</p>

<h1 id="v2-authentication-verification-requirements">V2: Authentication Verification Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="control-objective-1">Control Objective</h2>
<p>Authentication is the act of establishing, or confirming, something (or someone) as authentic, that is, that claims made by a person or about a device are true, resistant to impersonation, and prevents recovery or interception of memorized secrets (passwords).</p>
<p>NIST 800-63 is a modern, evidence based standard, and represents the best advice available in 2018. The standard is extremely helpful for all organizations all over the world, but is particularly relevant to US agencies and those dealing with US agencies. Implementers requiring the full set of controls should review the entire standard, especially regarding evidence of identity, identity binding, identity assertion, the deployment and management of multi-factor, biometric and crypto devices, security usability, and a great deal more advanced topics.</p>
<p>Verifications below are selected to address modern authentication threats such as credential stuffing, phishing, breached, weak or default memorized secrets, but by necessity are not a complete set of controls. If you require full NIST 800-63 compliance, please use this list as unit or integration tests to demonstrate a sampling of essential controls. Full compliance with the ASVS 3.1 is not the same as full compliance with NIST 800-63.</p>
<p>ASVS V2 Authentication, V3 Session Management, and V4 Access Controls has been adapted to be a compliant subset of selected NIST 800-63 B controls, focused around commonly exploited authentication weaknesses. Previous verification requirements have been retired, de-duped, or in most cases adapted to either be identical or strongly aligned with the intent of NIST 800-63 normative (mandatory) requirements. New NIST 800-63 verifications are enumerated from V2.40 onwards.</p>
<p>Authentication Access Levels (AAL) replace L1 .. L3 in these chapters. You should use NIST 800-63 § 6.2 to determine the correct authentication assurance level (AAL) for your application. In some cases, AAL1 weakens L1 controls as documented in previous versions of ASVS. If you wish to retain those controls, choose AAL2 or AAL3 instead as per the risk of your application.</p>
<p>We strongly urge everyone to adopt NIST 800-63, and align any policies, guidelines and standards with it, such as we've done here.</p>

<h1 id="v8-error-handling-and-logging-verification-requirements">V8: Error Handling and Logging Verification Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="control-objective-6">Control Objective</h2>
<p>The primary objective of error handling and logging is to provide a useful reaction by the user, administrators, and incident response teams. The objective is not to create massive amounts of logs, but high quality logs, with more signal than discarded noise.</p>
<p>High quality logs will often contain sensitive data, and must be protected as per local data privacy laws or directives. This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not collecting or logging sensitive information if not specifically required.</li>
<li>Ensuring all logged information is handled securely and protected as per its data classification.</li>
<li>Ensuring that logs are not forever, but have an absolute lifetime that is as short as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>If logs contain private or sensitive data, the definition of which varies from country to country, the logs become some of the most sensitive information held by the application and thus very attractive to attackers in their own right.</p>

<h1 id="v9-data-protection-verification-requirements">V9: Data Protection Verification Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="control-objective-7">Control Objective</h2>
<p>There are three key elements to sound data protection: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA). This standard assumes that data protection is enforced on a trusted system, such as a server, which has been hardened and has sufficient protections.</p>
<p>Applications have to assume that all user devices are compromised in some way. Where an application transmits or stores sensitive information on insecure devices, such as shared computers, phones and tablets, the application is responsible for ensuring data stored on these devices is encrypted and cannot be easily illicitly obtained, altered or disclosed.</p>
<p>Ensure that a verified application satisfies the following high level data protection requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality: Data should be protected from unauthorized observation or disclosure both in transit and when stored.</li>
<li>Integrity: Data should be protected being maliciously created, altered or deleted by unauthorized attackers.</li>
<li>Availability: Data should be available to authorized users as required.</li>

<li>Notes on “Approved modes of TLS”. In the past, the ASVS referred to the US standard FIPS 140-2, but as a global standard, applying US standards can be difficult, contradictory, or confusing to apply. A better method of achieving compliance with 10.8 would be to review guides such as <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS">Mozilla's Server Side TLS</a> or <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/">generate known good configurations</a>, and use known TLS evaluation tools, such as sslyze, various vulnerability scanners or trusted TLS online assessment services to obtain a desired level of security. In general, we see non-compliance for this section being the use of outdated or insecure ciphers and algorithms, the lack of perfect forward secrecy, outdated or insecure SSL protocols, weak preferred ciphers, and so on.</li>
